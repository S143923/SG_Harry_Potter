INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME
An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is

preparing food.

He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he

stops what

he's doing and walks to the door.
OLD MAN

Bloody kids.

He leaves the house and heads towards the light.

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. DARKNESS
The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit

torch.

He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He

begins climbing

the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming

from upstairs.

The old man waits outside the room where the

conversation is

taking place and listens on.
WORMTAIL
Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only
meant... perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy..
VOLDEMORT
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot
be done without him and it WILL be done

exactly as I say.
UNKNOWN MAN
I will not disappoint you my lord.
VOLDEMORT
Good. First, gather our old comrades.
Send them a sign.
A snake slithers past the old man and into the room.
VOLDEMORT
Nagini tells me the old caretaker is
standing outside the door.
Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old
man. The

old man looks terrified.
VOLDEMORT
Step aside so I can give our guest a
proper greeting.
A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of

panic.

(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge
a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory
was as you all know, exceptionally hard
working, intricately fair minded. And
most importantly a fierce fierce friend.
I think therefore you have the right
to know exactly how he died. You see,
Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord
Voldemort. The ministry of magic does
not wish me to tell you this. But not
to do so I think would be an insult
to his memory. Now the pain we all feel
at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds
us that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues,
our hearts beat as one. In light of
recent events the bonds of friendship
we made this year will be more important
than ever. Remember that and Cedric
Diggory will not have died in vain,
you remember that. And we'll celebrate
a boy who was kind and honest and brave
and true right to the very end.
