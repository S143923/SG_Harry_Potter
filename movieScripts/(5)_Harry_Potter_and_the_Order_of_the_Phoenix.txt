FADE IN 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. - LITTLE WHINGING - NIGHT 
It is sunset. We drift through the clouds, approaching NUMBER FOUR, PRIVET DRIVE. We sail over the roof of NUMBER FOUR and continue on past it into the street. 
We drift down into an abandoned playground. A lone figure sits on the only unbroken swing.. It is HARRY POTTER. He appears deep in thought. 
Had he been watching more carefully, he would have seen the old MRS. FIGG watching him from her front porch. 
MRS. FIGG adjusts her porch chair in order to watch Harry better. 
The sound of harsh laughter reaches Harry's ears. He looks up. Dudley and his gang of followers are walking down the street, telling crude jokes and laughing. 
They ignore Harry and continue on out of sight. Harry gets to his feet and follows them. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Harry rounds the corner, only to find himself surrounded by Dudley's gang. 
DUDLEY Oh, it's you. 
GANG THUG #1 What should we do with him, Big D? 
Harry laughs. 
HARRY Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums. 
DUDLEY Shut up! 
One of Dudley's gang steps in as if to punch Harry. Harry glares at him. 
The gang member pauses, then steps back again. 
DUDLEY Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you? 
2. 
HARRY What? 
MRS. FIGG stands up and goes to the edge of her porch. 
MRS. FIGG You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents! 
They pause and edge away from Harry. 
DUDLEY I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. "No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!" 
Dudley's gang laughs.HARRY Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you... 
DUDLEY Why should I? 
Harry whips out his wand and points it at Dudley. 
HARRY Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are! 
Dudley's gang laughs at Harry. Dudley, on the other hand, is terrified. 
DUDLEY (terrified) Don't point that thing at me! 
HARRY Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away. 
Dudley quivers, then finally complies. 
DUDLEY G-go home!GANG MEMBER #3 What? 
3. 
DUDLEY Get out of here! 
Suddenly nervous, they turn and edge away, soon vanishing into the night. 
Harry tightened his grip on his wand, glaring fourteen years of hatred and rage at Dudley. 
HARRY (cont.) Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand? 
DUDLEY Don't point that thing at me! 
HARRY I SAID, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?! 
Suddenly, a cold wind blows through the street, causing everyone to shiver. Harry exhales and his breath is tinged with frost. 
The street lights flicker, die, and frost over. 
Dudley is turning in a circle, terrified. 
DUDLEY What's happening? 
HARRY Quiet! 
The stars go out, plunging them into darkness. 
Dudley yells in fear. 
Harry turns to the end of the street. Gliding as smooth as death over the street, tattered robes drifting in the wind, comes a DEMENTOR. 
HARRY Dudley! Run! 
He turns, grabs his cousin by the arm and drags him down an alleyway. Beyond the mouth of the alleyway is the next street, and Number Four, Privet Drive. 
HARRY Come on! 
4. 
They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back. 
Harry spots a fire escape ladder, leading onto the roof of the house. 
He taps Dudley on the back, and starts to point to it, when Dudley turns and punches Harry in the jaw. Dazed, Harry stumbles backwards and falls to his back. His glasses slide from his face. His wand clatters away from him. 
Crying, Dudley runs away from Harry, towards the first dementor. 
HARRY Dudley, no! 
Harry feels the ground for his glasses but cannot find them. His hands scrabble on the ground in desperation. 
HARRY Lumos! 
Three feet away from him, his wand lights up. Harry snatches it up and turns. 
The dementor closes the distance to Harry swiftly, and is suddenly right before him. 
Harry raises his wand.HARRY 'Expecto Patronum!' 
A wisp of misty light protrudes from the tip of his wand, but not enough. Harry stiffens and gasps. 
The dementor closes in for the kill. 
VOLDEMORT (V.O.) Bow to death, Harry... 
LILY POTTER (V.O.) Haaaaaaaarry!... 
Harry falls onto his back, and the dementor closes the distance. 
Dudley SCREAMS in the black. Harry glances at him. 
5. 
Dudley is on his back, hands pulled apart by the other dementor, and the great cloaked head lowering to deliver the kiss. 
Harry raises his wand in desperation. 
HARRY 'EXPECTO PATRONUM!' 
There is a blinding explosion of light as Harry's PATRONOUS bursts forth, blasting the dementor backwards and away. 
The light INTENSIFIES, PULSATING from Harry»s wand, expanding to fill the alley with wave after pulsing wave of PURE LIGHT. 
The dementors flee. 
The stars, and street lamps flicker to life again. 
Dudley lays on the ground, whimpering and shaking. 
FOOTSTEPS from behind Harry. He turns, wand at the ready, to see UNCLE VERNON and AUNT PETUNIA running up to him. He starts to lower it. 
But they are staring dumbfounded into the sky, watching the Dementors soar away. 
VERNON What the hell are those? 
HARRY Dementors. 
Petunia kneels on the ground next to Dudley. 
PETUNIA What happened, Duddikins? 
Vernon turns on Harry, who hastily lowers his wand. 
VERNON What the hell is a dementoid? 
Petunia seizes Dudley and attempts to look into his mouth. 
PETUNIA They didn't--? 
HARRY No. 
Vernon shoves a large finger at Harry. 
6. 
VERNON I want some answers! 
HARRY We were attacked. 
VERNON By those...things? 
HARRY They»re evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth. 
PETUNIA They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. 
Vernon and Harry look dumbfounded. 
VERNON How do you know that? 
Petunia shakes her head, looking panicky. 
Vernon helps Dudley unsteadily to his feet, patting him on the shoulder. 
VERNON Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two? 
HARRY You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.' 
VERNON Why is he all right then? 
HARRY Because I used magic to save his life! 
The street-lights die, plunging the street into darkness. 
Several cloaked people appear around them on the street. The Dursleys yell in surprise. 
They move closer. Harry stands, brandishing his wand. 
HARRY Lumos! 
7. 
Ten wizards stand around them, wands out. Mad-eye Moody, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Elphias Doge, Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, Sturgis Podmore, and Hestia Jones. 
VERNON Who are all you lot? 
MOODY Quiet, Dursley. 
LUPIN Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here. 
HARRY (nodding) Nox. 
Darkness returns to the street, which is now lit only by the light of the moon. 
HARRY What are you doing here? 
LUPIN We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear. 
HARRY How»d he know? It just happened! 
LUPIN You didn»t think Dumbledore»d let you wander around on your own, did you? 
Lupin indicates Tonks.LUPIN Harry, I don»t believe you»ve met Nymphadora Tonks. 
She smiles at him. 
LUPIN Tonks, would you go get Harry»s broom from the house? 
She nods and departs. 
Harry looks at Lupin.HARRY What's been going on? What's Lord Vol- 
Three of the advanced guard jump. 
MOODY We're not talking about it here, it's too risky. 
Moody's eye stuck backwards in his head. 
MOODY Blast it. 
He pulls his eye from it's socket with a horrible sucking sound. 
TONKS Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting? 
MOODY I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.HARRY How are we getting there? 
LUPIN Brooms. 
Red sparks fly into the air in the distance. 
Tonks returns with the broom, handing it to Harry. 
KINGSLEY There's the first signal. 
MOODY Right, let's go. 
LUPIN On your broom, Harry. 
Moody is moving around them. 
MOODY Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! 
8. 
9. 
The advanced guard surrounds Harry. 
MOODY We'll be flying in close-quarters formation. Tonks will be right in front of you, keep close to her at all times. (pause) Don't stop, and whatever you do, don't break formation. If any of us are killed, the rest of you, keep flying. (pause) If that were to happen, the survivors, fly to the east. The rear guard is standing by. They will find you. 
TONKS Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye. 
MOODY We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry. 
HARRY Uh, is that very likely? 
KINGSLEY No one's going to die. 
Blue sparks blast into the sky. 
LUPIN There's the second signal! 
MOODY Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go! 
Seconds later, there is an explosion of green sparks in the sky. 
MOODY The third signal, everyone. Let's go! 
They kick off from the ground, which is swiftly left behind. 
MOODY Stay in formation! 
10. 
They are not as high as the clouds yet. 
MOODY We need more height! 
It is only seconds later, that another warning is shouted their way. 
A dementor soars towards them, tattered robes snapping in the wind. 
MOODY Contacts to the south! 
KINGSLEY Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down! 
The rest of the advanced guard peels away from the group. 
Harry checks the sky around them. It appears to be clear. 
LUPIN There's the other one, Alastor! 
The other Dementor emerges very close by from a cloud. 
HARRY Expecto--!LUPIN Harry, leave it to us! 
And Lupin peels away, rocketing towards the Dementor. 
HARRY No! 
Lupin goes straight at the Dementor, which smoothly flips upwards, bypassing Lupin, but Lupin twists his broom around, his wand drawn, and points it at the Dementor's retreating back. 
LUPIN 'Expecto Patronum!' 
Lupin's PATRONOUS explodes from his wand tip, pulsing out through the clouds at the Dementor. The light blasts into it, and the Dementor, shrieking eerily, retreats back towards the rest of the advanced guard. 
Lupin rockets past Harry, Tonks, and Moody. 
11. 
LUPIN Get Harry to the safe house! 
MOODY Come on, Potter! Keep moving! 
HARRY But I can help! 
MOODY Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move! 
Glaring at Moody, Harry wheels his broom around and the three of them set off again, leaving the battle behind. 
MOODY We're not far, now! 
Soon after, Lupin and the rest of the advanced guard return, intact and without injury. 
MOODY Did you get rid of them? 
KINGSLEY They're gone, Alastor. 
TONKS We're there!MOODY Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry! 
They cut through the clouds, gliding lower as they went. Tonks touches down right before Harry did, the rest gliding down while maintaining their formation around Harry. 
All business, they draw their wands. 
LUPIN Stay here, Harry. 
Several of the advanced guard move to the perimeter, to secure it. 
KINGSLEY Clear! 
MOODY Right, Harry, this way. 
12. 
Harry follows him, Tonks and Lupin trailing after, wands at the ready, eyes flicking to the buildings surrounding them. 
MOODY Here, read this. 
He hands Harry a piece of paper. It has written on it: "The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, London." 
Harry looks at the gap between the houses, and suddenly a door appears, followed by the rest of a large, gray, rather imposing house. 
Moody takes the paper from Harry and set it afire with his wand. 
MOODY Come on, inside. Hurry. 
LUPIN and TONKS step up, close to Harry, one on either side. The guards at the perimeter close in a semi-circle around the door. 
LUPIN taps the door with his wand, and it cracks open. 
LUPIN Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 
Harry enters the musty entry hall. To one side is a staircase leading up to the next level. At the base of the stair is a dirty, graying sheet hanging on the wall, as if it were covering something. 
Behind him, the other members of the advanced guard are entering. To make room, Harry steps to one side, and runs into an umbrella stand, which clangs loudly as it hits the ground. 
To steady himself, he reaches out and pulls the sheet from the wall. Behind it is a portrait of an unpleasant, old, thin, woman. 
MRS. BLACK Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?! 
13. 
SIRIUS BLACK comes running into the entry hall. He skids to a halt next to Harry, looking up at MRS BLACK. 
SIRIUS Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet! 
MRS BLACK Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!SIRIUS Yes, yes, do shut up! 
He throws the sheet over the picture, and the yells die away. 
Panting, SIRIUS looks at Harry and grins. He wraps Harry in a huge bear hug. Harry laughs. 
Pulling away, Sirius smiles at Harry. 
HARRY Was that your--? 
SIRIUS Mother, yes. Dear old mum. 
HARRY But...why here? 
SIRIUS This house has been my family's for centuries. It's mine now. (pause) I'm the last of the Blacks. I offered it up as headquarters for, well, and Dumbledore accepted. It's about the most useful thing I've been able to do for a long while. 
MRS WEASLEY enters the hall. 
MRS WEASLEY Hello, Harry dear. 
HARRY Mrs. Weasley! 
MRS WEASLEY Sirius, the meeting is about to start! 
14. 
SIRIUS Right. 
MRS WEASLEY Harry, dear, go on upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up there. 
Harry looks up the stairs. 
HERMIONE Harry! 
Harry looks up the stairs and sees RON and HERMIONE standing on the landing. He mounts the stairs to both of them, grinning. 
Hermione throws herself on Harry in a large hug, laughing. 
RON Let him breathe, Hermione! 
HERMIONE Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are! 
RON HERMIONE! 
Hermione lets Harry go and takes a deep breath. 
RON Good to see you, mate. 
HERMIONE Come on, inside. 
They enter an adjacent bedroom. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They sit down on separate beds. 
HERMIONE Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to. 
RON We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. 
There is an awkward silence. 
HARRY Right. 
RON He thought you would be safest there. 
HARRY Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is. 
HERMIONE He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary... 
HARRY So, why's he keeping me in the dark? 
Hermione and Ron look awkward. 
HARRY Didn't you bother asking? 
RON We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy. 
HARRY So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here. 
RON It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings. 
HARRY You've still been here! 
Hermione and Ron are looking aghast at Harry. 
Harry looks away. There is a silence. 
HARRY What's been going on? 
RON We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things. 
15. 
16. 
HERMIONE Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy. (pause) And they're guarding something. 
HARRY What»s this Order everyone»s talking about? 
HERMIONE The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term. 
Moments later, MRS. WEASLEY opens the door to their room. 
MRS WEASLEY You can come down now, the meeting's over. 
They stand up to go. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley enter the KITCHEN, which has been set up with long tables and chairs. 
At the far end of the long table, MR. WEASLEY and CHARLIE WEASLEY are talking quietly over a parchment. 
MRS WEASLEY Arthur- 
MR. WEASLEY looks up, sees them, and nods to Charlie, who rolls up the parchment hastily, and rises from his seat, moving across the room. 
Harry sits down at the table, across from Sirius. 
SIRIUS Well, the Ministry is furious with you. 
HARRY Why? 
SIRIUS You did magic in front of your muggle cousin. 
(MORE) 
You»ll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow. 
HARRY Okay. 
Harry stands up. 
HARRY I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.SIRIUS You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort. 
Harry pauses, then turns around. The room has gone very still. Mrs. Weasley is glaring at Sirius. 
HARRY I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything. 
MRS WEASLEY And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young-- 
SIRIUS He has a right to know, Molly. 
MRS WEASLEY It's not your decision! 
SIRIUS I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something. 
HARRY (grinning) Yeah. 
SIRIUS He's not a child, Molly. 
MRS WEASLEY He's not an adult either! (pause) He's not James. 
17. 
SIRIUS (cont'd) 
18. 
SIRIUS (stiffly) I'm fully aware of who he is, Molly. 
MRS WEASLEY I only have Harry's best interests at heart. 
SIRIUS He's not your son. 
MRS WEASLEY Who else does he have, then? 
Sirius stands, glaring at Mrs. Weasley. 
SIRIUS He's got me. He's like a son to me. 
Harry stares at Sirius in surprise. Mrs. Weasley turns and storms out. 
Sirius sits, heavily.SIRIUS What do you want to know, Harry? 
HARRY Where's Voldemort? What's he doing? 
SIRIUS He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change. 
LUPIN (smiling) You really messed things up for him last year, Harry. 
HARRY How? 
SIRIUS The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore. 
HARRY And what's his plan? 
19. 
SIRIUS He's building up his army again, just like before. 
HARRY And you're stopping him from gaining followers? 
LUPIN We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult. 
SIRIUS You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back. 
HARRY But...why?LUPIN Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked. 
HARRY But you're telling people, right? 
Sirius laughed. 
SIRIUS Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry... 
LUPIN But Dumbledore is doing all he can. 
MR. WEASLEY If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to-- 
MR WEASLEY stops short and looks as if he'd nearly said too much. 
HARRY What? 
20. 
SIRIUS You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon. 
HARRY What kind of weapon? 
Lupin and Sirius exchange looks. 
LUPIN I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Harry sleeps. He dreams. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Harry moves slowly down a dark hallway. It has many, bolted doors down its long sides. 
Soon he is running. Then, suddenly, he is being pulled along, the doors rushing past faster and faster. Harry can see the end of the hallway, it is a blinding light, still only a speck. 
It grows larger as he rockets towards it, then he flies right into it and the light explodes all around him, engulfing him. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Harry wakes with a CRY, sitting straight up in bed. He»s covered in sweat, looking disturbed. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. HALL - DAY 
MRS. WEASLEY, MR WEASLEY, LUPIN, RON, HERMIONE, and GINNY are standing in the hall, waiting, as Sirius and Harry descend the stairs. 
MRS WEASLEY Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep? 
HARRY No, my scar kept hurting. 
MR. WEASLEY and LUPIN exchange nervous glances. 
21. 
MR WEASLEY (bracingly) Probably just nerves... 
HARRY Yeah...nerves... 
MRS. WEASLEY Good luck, Harry! 
She hugs Harry. 
After the hug, Harry stands back, but is suddenly hugged by Hermione. 
HERMIONE They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending yourself! I checked the laws. 
HARRY Thanks, Hermione. 
RON What does he get a hug for? 
HERMIONE (cooly) When you have to go to a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic, I'll hug you too. 
RON Oh, sure, that's why. 
HERMIONE (laughing) Ronald Weasley, are you jealous? 
RON (glancing at the smirking Ginny and Mrs. Weasley) Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all... 
HERMIONE Would you like a hug? 
22. 
RON (miffed) No, I'd hate to force you... 
Harry grins and shakes his head. 
MR WEASLEY Well, come on, Harry. Time to go. 
HARRY Bye. 
He waves, and he and MR WEASLEY depart. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 
The street is not very crowded, as the sun rises in the east. 
Harry and Mr. Weasley hurry along the sidewalk and come to a PHONEBOOTH. 
Mr. Weasley looks around cautiously. 
MR WEASLEY Good, good, not very many Muggles. 
He opens the PHONEBOOTH and slips inside. He beckons to Harry. 
MR WEASLEY Well, come on Harry, in we go. 
Harry slips inside the booth, and Mr. Weasley, with some difficulty, closes the door behind them. 
Mr. Weasley picks up the phone and listens in the wrong end for a moment. 
MR WEASLEY I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again... 
He punches in SIX, TWO, FOUR, FOUR, TWO. 
There is a tap on the glass of the box. Mr. Weasley glances out of the window to see a MUGGLE MAN standing outside. The MAN taps his watch impatiently. 
Mr. Weasley holds up a finger, as to say, "just a second." 
The MAN sighs and turns around, tapping his foot. 
23. 
FEMALE VOICE Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business. 
MR. WEASLEY Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing. 
FEMALE VOICE Pleas stand by. 
There is a pause, and then the whole phone booth begins to sink down into the ground. 
The MAN, his back to the booth, is completely oblivious. 
INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY 
The booth sinks lower into the ground. 
MR WEASLEY Usually I Apparate, but you're too young, so I thought we'd take the scenic route. 
The booth SHUDDERS to a halt, and the door slides open, revealing a large lobby, filled with busy-looking wizards and witches going to and fro. 
Harry and Mr. Weasley exit the phone booth and enter the lobby. 
The door to the PHONE BOOTH closes, and it slides up again, out of sight. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. STREET - DAY 
THe MUGGLE MAN stands tapping his foot. 
The booth reemerges topside and stops, looking very innocent. 
The man turns around, blinks, and glances around for the two people that had been inside it before. 
INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY 
Mr. Weasley walks through the crowd of wizards. 
MR WEASLEY Keep close, Harry! 
A stooped, timid-looking, white-haired wizard pushes his way through the crowd towards Mr. Weasley. 
24. 
MR WEASLEY Ah, Perkins, good morn- 
PERKINS Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing. 
MR WEASLEY Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that. 
PERKINS It started at eight! 
MR WEASLEY Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry! 
They break into a run. They jog down hallway after hallway, then Mr Weasley leads Harry onto a large lift. 
There are several other witches and wizards on it. 
It descends shudderingly for a few moments, then stops. 
FEMALE VOICE Department of Mysteries. 
HARRY Department of Mysteries? 
MR WEASLEY Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret. 
The lift doors open. Harry and Mr. Weasley exit, running down corridors. 
Harry skids to a stop and looks down a dark hallway. Mr. Weasley stops as well, and glances back at Harry. 
MR. WEASLEY Come on, Harry! 
HARRY I've been there before... 
Mr. WEASLEY looks nervous, then grabs Harry's robes and drag him along. 
MR. WEASLEY Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely... 
25. 
A few moments later, they arrive. 
MR. WEASLEY There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck... 
Harry enters the chamber. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
One side of the courtroom is an elevated zigarat-shaped series of seats carved from black stone. 
The whole room is dark, save a light shining through from the ceiling down on the center of the room, where a single wooden chair sits, covered in chains. 
FUDGE You're late.HARRY Er...sorry.FUDGE No matter, the accused will take his seat. 
Harry does so, glancing nervously at the chains on it. 
FUDGE Very well, we are ready to begin. 
DUMBLEDORE Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. 
Harry turns in his seat. 
Dumbledore stands by the door of the COURTROOM, looking up at the Minister. 
FUDGE Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you? 
DUMBLEDORE (cheerfully) Must have missed it. (pause) However, due to a fortunate mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. 
26. 
DUMBLEDORE conjures up a SQUASHY, CHINTZ armchair next to Harry's and sits down with a mild squeak. 
He steeples his fingers and looks up at the Minister with an expression of polite interest. 
FUDGE Well. The...ah...charges. 
He consults his notes.FUDGE The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle. (pause) (To Harry) You are Harry James Potter? 
HARRY Yes. 
FUDGE And you conjured a patronus on the night of the eleventh of August? 
HARRY Yes, but- 
FUDGE Within full sight of a Muggle? 
HARRY Yes, but- 
SUSAN BONES You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape? 
HARRY Yes. 
SUSAN BONES That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter. 
FUDGE It doesn't matter how impressive it was! 
HARRY But I did it because of the Dementors!SUSAN BONES What do you mean? 
HARRY My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away. 
FUDGE Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story. 
HARRY It's the truth! 
FUDGE (sarcastically) Of course it is. 
SUSAN BONES Dementors in Little Whinging? 
FUDGE Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying. 
DUMBLEDORE Actually, we have a witness to the presence of the Dementors in question. 
FUDGE We haven't got time to- 
DUMBLEDORE I may be wrong, but I do believe that it says somewhere in the Wizagammot Charter of Rights that the Accused has the right to present witnesses to prove his or her case? In fact, I do believe I wrote that particular bit myself. 
27. 
FUDGE Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness. 
Percy goes to the door and lets MRS. FIGG in. 
She stands in front of Harry and Dumbledore nervously. 
FUDGE Full name?MRS. FIGG Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging. 
FUDGE So...what is your story? 
FIGG I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys. 
SUSAN BONES What did the Dementors look like? 
FIGG Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks. 
There is some murmuring among the Wizengamot at that. 
SUSAN BONES Anything else? 
FIGG I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.FUDGE Very well, you may go. 
MRS FIGG hurrys from the COURTROOM. 
FUDGE Not very convincing. 
SUSAN BONES Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely. 
28. 
29. 
FUDGE So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not... 
DUMBLEDORE Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius. 
FUDGE Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore. 
UMBRIDGE shifts into the light. She is a short, ugly, toad- like woman. 
UMBRIDGE Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy? 
DUMBLEDORE If the Dementors are taking their orders from the Ministry exclusively, then it must certainly follow logically that someone in the Ministry ordered the attack. (pause) And in that case, I'm sure the Ministry will make a full inquiry. 
FUDGE Dementors are irrelevant! 
DUMBLEDORE On the contrary, Cornelius. If they were there, then Harry was acting in self-defense, which is perfectly allowable under Clause Seven of the Decree of Reasonable Restriction of Underaged Wizardry. (pause) We are all in agreement on this? 
FUDGE Well, yes, if he's telling the truth! 
DUMBLEDORE You have heard it from eye- witnesses, Cornelius. 
30. 
FUDGE Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges? 
He glances around the room, noting all the hands in the air. 
FUDGE All opposed? 
Only a few hands. 
FUDGE (angrily) Fine! Cleared of all charges! 
DUMBLEDORE Excellent. 
Dumbledore gets out of his chair, vanishes it with the wave of a wand, and sweeps from the COURTROOM. 
Harry gets out of the wooden chair, glances upward at Umbridge. 
Their eyes meet for a split second. She glowers at him. 
Harry exits. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. HALL - DAY 
Harry exits the COURTROOM to find Mr. Weasley standing outside, beaming. 
MR. WEASLEY Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful! 
The door opens again and the whole of the Wizengamot exits. 
MR WEASLEY You were tried by the full court? 
HARRY I think so, yeah. 
MR. WEASLEY (concerned) Well, no matter. Let's go home. 
Just then, Percy exits and brushes by Mr. Weasley without even looking at him. 
31. 
HARRY Er...is Percy mad at you? 
MR WEASLEY Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left. 
They begin walking away from the courtroom, when they come upon Fudge talking quietly with LUCIUS MALFOY, standing at the mouth of the corridor Harry had recognized earlier. 
LUCIUS Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter. (pause) The Minister here was just telling me how very lucky an escape you just had. Quite astonishing...snakelike, in fact. 
HARRY What are you doing here? 
LUCIUS Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours. 
Lucius moves closer to Harry. 
LUCIUS (lowly) All you need to concern yourself about are...your dreams, Potter. 
And Lucius smiles malevolently at Harry. 
Lucius steps back and turns to the Minister. 
LUCIUS Shall we continue this in your office, Fudge? 
FUDGE Certainly. 
Harry watches them go. 
32. 
HARRY If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here? 
MR WEASLEY Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension. 
As he speaks, Mr Weasley glances down the long, dark hallway, with a worried look.

INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY 
Harry stands in the kitchen of GRIMMAULD PLACE, surrounded by Ron, Ginny, Fred, George, Hermione, Sirius, Lupin, Mr and Mrs Weasley, and Tonks. 
RON (shouting) I knew it! 
In the background, Ginny, Fred, and George are dancing a strange JIG. 
FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY (singing) He got off, he got off, he got off! 
Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her. 
MR WEASLEY Settle down, you three! 
The chanting and dancing dies away. Mrs Weasley exits the Kitchen. 
MR WEASLEY Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you? 
SIRIUS Yeah, absolutely. 
MR WEASLEY Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with. 
FRED George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet. 
33. 
GEORGE Right you are, Fred. 
MR WEASLEY Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late. 
Harry's scar explodes in pain. He yelps, and claps his hands to his forehead. 
SIRIUS Harry! 
Harry gasps with pain and falls to his knees. Then, as suddenly as it had come, the pain vanishes. Shaken, Harry gasps as Sirius helps him over to a chair. 
SIRIUS You all right, Harry? 
HARRY Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger. 
Sirius gives a worried glance to Lupin, who looks grim. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Harry sits on his bunk, thinking. Sirius enters the room, but Harry barely reacts, still gazing into space. 
SIRIUS Harry, I've got something that might interest you. 
Harry looks up. Sirius sits on the edge of the bed and brandishes an old, tattered photo. 
Harry takes it. 
SIRIUS This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning. 
Harry looks down at all the smiling faces. 
SIRIUS There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after (MORE) 
this was taken...; 
then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.. (pause) Ah, Edgar Bones, they only ever found bits of him; Caradoc Dearborn, he vanished six months later...; Hagrid, of course; Gideon and Fabian Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to finish those two off; me, of course...; and there they are! 
Harry watches his parents beam up at him. 
HARRY My parents. 
He watches the picture for a long second. 
HARRY I miss them, Sirius... 
SIRIUS I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too. 
He puts his arm around Harry. 
SIRIUS It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't... 
Harry closes his eyes.HARRY Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why? 
SIRIUS I don't know, Harry. I wish I did, but I don't... 
There is a long moment of silence. 
SIRIUS I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it... 
HARRY Thanks. 
34. 
SIRIUS (cont'd) 
35. 
The door cracks open, and an ugly, menacing HOUSE ELF enters, looking around suspiciously. 
KREACHER (muttering) That mudblood with the scar, he cries, why does he cry so...? 
SIRIUS Kreacher, get out of here! Now! 
KREACHER Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house... 
The elf exits. 
HARRY Who..who was that? 
SIRIUS Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny.(pause) You'd better get some rest. 
Sirius gets up and exits. 
Ron and Hermione burst into the room seconds later. 
HERMIONE Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! 
She hands Harry a letter. 
There are a few seconds of parchment ripping. 
HERMIONE What about you, Harry? 
But there is no PREFECT BADGE in Harry's letter. 
He shakes his head. 
HERMIONE Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one! 
HARRY I'm sure. Nothing. 
36. 
There is an awkward moment. 
HARRY So...congratulations Ron, Hermione...HERMIONE Well...thanks Harry. 
RON Come on, lets go back downstairs! 
HARRY Yes, do go enjoy yourselves. 
Harry lays down on his bed away from them. He hears them leave. 
He is alone.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione exit the HOGWARTS EXPRESS and move quickly though the crowd of students to the carriages that would take them to the castle. 
As they prepare to climb into one of the carriages, Harry stops and stares towards the front of the carriage. 
There is a large reptilian, horse-like creature harnessed to the front whereas always before there was nothing. 
HARRY What is that? 
RON (looking) What? 
HARRY (pointing) That...that...thing! 
RON stares for a long moment, then looks at Harry. 
RON Harry, there's nothing there, mate... 
37. 
HARRY Yes it is, it's right there! 
He points. Ron shakes his head. 
LUNA LOVEGOOD I see them too, Harry. 
Harry turns to her. LUNA LOVEGOOD is a spacy-looking girl, yet pretty in her own right. 
HARRY Er...you are? 
LUNA Luna. Luna Lovegood. 
HARRY Well, thanks Luna. 
They clamber into the carriage, Luna following. It starts moving.

HARRY Hagrid's cabin looks deserted. 
HERMIONE I hope he's all right... 
RON What if he were still on his... 
He glances at Luna, who has vanished behind the latest edition of the QUIBBLER MAGAZINE. 
RON ...what if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore? 
HARRY Yeah, could be. 
Moments later the carriages halt, and the students pile out.

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. HOGWARTS GREAT HALL - NIGHT 
Hogwarts Headmaster, PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE, a wizzened old man with a great white beard to his belt and long white hair, stands to address the school. 
DUMBLEDORE I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley... 
Fred and George stand and take a bow to cheering, laughter, and yells. 
DUMBLEDORE (CONT»D) ...which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door. 
Harry grins at Fred and George. 
DUMBLEDORE Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange glances. 
DUMBLEDORE Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts- 
At this, UMBRIDGE stands and clears her throat. 
UMBRIDGE Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school? 
Dumbledore looks taken aback. McGonogall glares at UMBRIDGE. 
Dumbledore sits down and invites Umbridge forward. 
39. 
UMBRIDGE Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position. 
Dumbledore inclines his head. There is murmuring from the students. 
UMBRIDGE The Ministry has always considered the magical education of our children to be of vital importance, and the passing down of this ancient and noble art must be given to the next generation, lest it be lost forever... (pause) Without progress, stagnation. But progress for progress's sake is to be discouraged, for our art requires no tinkering. (pause) A balance must be attained, the new and the old, permanence and change, tradition and innovation, order and chaos.(pause) There are large changes coming soon, changes walking the fine line between order and chaos. Know only that these changes are for the best, and to prevent the destruction of our civilization from its own decay. Thank you. 
Umbridge smiles at them all, but to Harry, the smile seems a little forced, a little fake.

INT. GRIFFINDOR DORMS - NIGHT 
Harry enters the boys DORMITORY. Within the room are a number of POSTER BEDS. Harry goes to his and sits down. 
Also in the room are DEAN THOMAS, NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, and SEAMUS FINNIGAN. 
DEAN So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus? 
HARRY What? 
SEAMUS Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts... 
HARRY Why? 
SEAMUS Well...because of you... 
HARRY What did I do? 
SEAMUS She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter... 
HARRY Where'd she get that from? 
Seamus picks up an edition of the DAILY PROPHET and tosses it to Harry. Harry catches it and looks at the front page. 
It READS: "Harry Potter: Boy Hero Uses Lies to Seek Attention" with the subheading of "Hogwarts Headmaster Buys His Story." 
HARRY So...she believes this stuff? 
SEAMUS Well...yeah... 
HARRY But...but you believe me, don't you? 
Seamus looks away. Harry turns and storms out of the DORM.

HARRY No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...

INT. CLASS - DAY 
The whole class looks around at Harry as he comes staggering in. 
HARRY Sorry, Professor... 
PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE smiles, TOAD-LIKE, at Harry. 
UMBRIDGE Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late. 
Harry frowns, but sits down next to Ron and Hermione. 
UMBRIDGE Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it? (pause) Know now that this is about to be rectified. 
(MORE) 
42. 
UMBRIDGE (cont'd) 
I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan. 
She waves her wand at the blackboard and words are written down on it. 
UMBRIDGE Copy this down. 
Everyone opens their books and begins copying, except Hermione, who sits with her book unopened, her hand in the air. 
Umbridge ignores her. 
However, within the next few seconds, nearly the whole class is watching Hermione. Umbridge sighs. 
UMBRIDGE Yes? 
HERMIONE I wanted to know something about your course aims. 
UMBRIDGE Well, they should be perfectly self- evident. 
HERMIONE Well, I don't think they are. They say nothing about actually doing spells. 
UMBRIDGE (laughing) I can imagine no circumstance in my class where you would need to use spells, my dear! 
HERMIONE But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application? 
UMBRIDGE Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert? 
HERMIONE No, but- 
43. 
UMBRIDGE Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment- 
HERMIONE But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?HARRY What good's theory in the real world? 
UMBRIDGE This is school, not the real world, Mr. Potter. There is nothing out there waiting to get you. 
HARRY What about Lord Voldemort? 
The whole class flinched at the sound of the name. 
UMBRIDGE Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight. 
She stands behind her desk, leaning on her knuckles. 
UMBRIDGE Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie. 
Harry stands up, knocking his books to the ground, a look of livid rage on his face. 
HARRY It-is-NOT-a-LIE! 
UMBRIDGE Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention! 
Harry moves around his desk stiffly, trembling with rage, his eyes dangerous. 
44. 
HARRY So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer? 
UMBRIDGE The boy's death was a tragic accident. 
Harry has reached the desk. He slams his fists against the wood, thrusting his face right up to Umbridge's, glaring at her. 
HARRY It was MURDER! I saw it happen! 
The class is deathly still. PARVATI PATIL is covering her mouth. 
UMBRIDGE Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions! 
HARRY Yeah, talk to somebody who cares. Voldemort killed Cedric, and you know it. 
Umbridge snatches a QUILL up and scribbles a note, and hands it to Harry. 
UMBRIDGE That goes to Professor McGonogall, dear. 
Harry rips it from her hand and storms out of the room.

She takes it and glances at it. 
MCGONOGALL Is this true? Did you shout at Professor Umbridge? 
45. 
HARRY Yeah. But she called me a liar! 
MCGONOGALL My dear boy, do use your common sense! Umbridge is reporting directly to Fudge. She is here to...interfere...with Dumbledore. And things could get much worse, trust me. (pause) Use caution, always, Potter. Do not mess with Dolorus Umbridge, she is dangerous. The Order's hands are tied at Hogwarts, Harry. If you get too deep into trouble, we may not be able to get you out. Do you understand?HARRY Yes, Professor. 
MCGONOGALL Good. Off you go.

RON You reckon she's here to spy on us? 
HERMIONE Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order. 
At that moment, ANGELINA JOHNSON comes up to them. 
ANGELINA (angrily) Well, way to go, Potter. Your detention is at the same time as Quidditch practice! 
HARRY Oh! Sorry...ANGELINA Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there.

INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
The door to her office creaks open, and Harry enters. 
UMBRIDGE Ah, Potter. Sit down. 
Harry sits in a chair right in front of her desk. 
UMBRIDGE You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill. 
The QUILL was BLOOD-RED and sinister looking. 
46. 
47. 
Harry takes it. 
UMBRIDGE You will write "I will not tell lies" until I tell you to stop. Understand?HARRY There's no ink. 
UMBRIDGE Oh...you won't need ink. 
Harry begins to write, then gasps in pain. He looks at his hand, and finds that "I will not tell lies" has carved itself in the skin of his hand, and the quill had written the words on the parchment in bright red BLOOD. 
Then the words healed over again, on his hand. 
Harry glances at Umbridge, who is smiling evilly. 
UMBRIDGE Problem, Potter? 
Harry shakes his head and returns to his lines. He gasps after writing it again, the words on his hand had gotten deeper. Gritting his teeth, he forces himself on. 
DISSOLVE 
Harry's shaking, weak hand scratches the final line of the evening, the words on the back of his hand not even healing any longer, but bleeding profusely. 
UMBRIDGE That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper. 
Harry staggers to his feet, weak and pale, and staggers from the office.

Harry moves down the dark hallway again, slowly, meaningfully. Locked doors are all around him, lining the walls as far down as he could see. 
He breaks into a jog, and then a run, then a sprint. The doors rush past him. 
Suddenly an invisible force grabs him and pulls him along, faster and faster, the doors a blur. Then he saw the end, a blinding light, which he blasts into with a SMACK, and as the light fades, he catches a glimpse of a further room, beyond the light, for only an instant. 
Then it too is gone, and Harry awakes with a yelp, hands pressed against his scar, which is BURNING horribly. 
He rubs it, until the pain goes away.

Harry shakes his head.HARRY No, I haven»t.

UMBRIDGE That»s enough for tonight, Potter. Let»s see that hand. 
She reaches out and touches his hand. Instantly, pain explodes in his scar and Harry leaps back as if electrocuted, stumbling due to blood loss. He clutches at his scar in agony. 
Harry stares at her in horror. She grins unpleasantly. 
He staggers backward and out the door to her office without another word.

RON Harry--bloody hell! 
Harry»s knees give out, and he falls to the floor. Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione lift him up. 
HERMIONE He»s got to be taken to the hospital wing. 
HARRY (weakly) No. Can»t give...Umbridge the satisfaction... 
FRED Umbridge did this? 
RON You said she was making you do lines! 
They settle Harry back down. 
HARRY She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink. 
HERMIONE That old hag! She»s sick! 
Hermione looks horrified. 
HERMIONE Oh, Harry. You»ve got to go to Dumbledore. You can»t keep this up.

HERMIONE Hagrid»s still not back yet. I hope he»s all right. 
HARRY I»ve asked Sirius about it. 
He indicates the parchment. Hermione pulls it towards her. She looks startled. 
HERMIONE Harry, you can»t write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn»t safe. 
HARRY Don»t worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention. RON Always knew she was a bit fishy. 
HERMIONE You think she»s working for You- Know-Who? 
HARRY Well, it»s a possibility, isn»t it? 
Hermione looks dubious. 
HERMIONE I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it»s unlikely. Dumbledore»d know. 
Harry leans in even closer. 
52. 
HARRY Yeah, but Dumbledore didn»t have a choice, did he? She»d been sent here by the Ministry. 
Hermione unfurls a copy of the Daily Prophet. 
RON Anything about Harry? 
HERMIONE No, nothing. (pause) Wait! Look at this! 
She slaps the paper down on the table. Harry and Ron lean closer. 
HERMIONE (reading) ≈Trespass at Ministry. Sturgis Podmore has appeared before the Wizengamot with charges of trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on the 31st of August. He was arrested when found trying to break into a top-security door at one in the morning. Podmore was convicted and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.

Harry steps into the OWLRY, the floor covered in straw and hundreds of owls hooting softly on many roosts. 
HARRY Hedwig! 
Hedwig flutters down to him. He gives the parchment to the owl. She flies out of the open window and soars away, out of sight over the Forbidden Forest. 
Harry watches the forest. A huge animal which appeared to be a winged reptilian horse. Harry frowns. 
Behind him, the door creaks open. He turns to see CHO CHANG entering. 
HARRY Hi. 
CHO Oh...hi. Didn»t think anyone else would be up here. 
She moves to a brown school owl. There is an awkward silence. 
CHO Have you found a new Keeper for Quiddich? 
HARRY Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley. 
She ties the package to the owl. 
CHO He any good?HARRY Well, he made the team. I missed the tryouts. 
She lets go of the owl and it flies out the window. 
54. 
CHO Yeah, Umbridge. You were really brave, standing up to her. 
Harry straightens, smiling. 
HARRY Yeah...well, it was the truth. 
The owlry door bursts open again. ARGUS FILCH charges in. 
FILCH Right, Potter. I»ll have what you»re sending. 
HARRY What? 
FILCH I have had a tip-off that you are ordering a large quantity of Dungbombs! Now hand it over. 
HARRY You»re too late, it»s gone. 
Filch looks furious. 
CHO Yeah, I saw him send it. 
Filch regards her for a moment, then turns back to Harry. 
FILCH I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb in this castle, Potter...and you»re mine. 
He turns and departs. 
There is a silence for a moment as Harry and Cho process what had happened. 
CHO Um, you weren»t ordering dungbombs, were you? 
HARRY No. 
55. 
CHO I wonder why he»d think you were. (pause) Well, see you, Harry.

HARRY Yeah, it doesn»t make any sense. 
HERMIONE Unless whoever tipped Filch off was interested in reading your mail, Harry. I mean, doesn»t it seem a little too coincidental that Filch was tipped off when you happened to be sending a message to Sirius? 
Harry looks thoughtful. 
HARRY Yeah, that does seem weird. You figure its Umbridge?

HARRY It»s your first practice. Don»t worry about it. 
Ron looks unusually pale. 
RON I»m gonna make a fool of myself out there. 
Harry gasps and rubs at his scar. 
HERMIONE Are you all right, Harry? 
HARRY Yeah. Its just...the pain»s getting stronger. 
Ron and Hermione exchange glances. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sit near each other in the common room. Around them, people talk, laugh, and study. 
Hermione sighs and shuts her book with a SNAP. 
HERMIONE I don»t know how we»re ever going to pass our O.W.L.s in Defense against the dark arts without any practice! That Umbridge woman is so... 
She looks at Harry and Ron. 
HERMIONE We»ve got to do something about her. 
The boys stare at her. 
57. 
RON Yeah, well, poison should do the trick. 
HERMIONE Don»t be silly, Ron. Not her, I meant her teaching. We»re not going to learn anything in that class. 
HARRY Yeah, that»s true. 
HERMIONE Anyway, I thought we should do it ourselves.RON Do what? 
HERMIONE Defense Against the Dark Arts. We»d teach ourselves. 
HARRY I don»t know... 
There is a TAPPING sound coming from the window. They turn and look. 
RON Hermes? 
He goes to the window and opens it. Hermes deposits a letter in Ron»s hands, turns, and vanishes out of the window again. 
The last Gryiffindor heads for bed, leaving the common room deserted except for the three of them. 
Ron opens it and returns to his seat. 
RON It»s from Percy! 
HARRY Read it. 
RON ≈Dear Ron, congratulations on becoming a Prefect. For some time I was worried you would take the «Fred and George» route instead of following in (MORE) 
my footsteps. 
You can imagine my relief that this is not the case. 
He looks incredulously at Harry and Hermione. 
HERMIONE Keep reading. 
RON ≈Given your attachment to using me as a role model, I will give you a bit of advice from one respecter of authority to another. (pause) It is likely that you have been seeing quite a lot of Harry Potter of late. I must recommend you break ties with that boy as soon as possible. He may be Dumbledore»s favorite, but Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer. Your loyalties should lie with the Ministry of Magic, not Dumbledore and Potter»s personality cult. (pause) Please do not fear breaking ties with Potter. If trouble arrises, go to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman. (pause) I hope you will carefully consider my advice to you, Ron. Don»t let the dangerous errors of Dumbledore, Potter, and unfortunately our parents lure you into destroying a perfectly good career. Percy. 
Ron looks up, aghast.HARRY Well, if you want to, ah, ≈break ties with me, I swear I won»t get violent. 
Ron tears the letter in half. 
RON He is the world»s biggest git! 
He hurls the pieces into the fireplace. 
SIRIUS Watch it! 
58. 
RON (cont'd) 
Ron jumps, startled. 
HARRY Sirius? 
SIRIUS Right you are. Got you letter and though we should talk in person. 
He cranes his neck at the burning letter. 
SIRIUS What was that? 
HARRY Letter from Percy. 
RON Yeah, full of the usual rubbish. 
HERMIONE Except he did mention that Dumbledore might not be in charge here much longer. 
SIRIUS It doesn»t surprise me. Fudge wants Dumbledore out. 
HARRY Why? 
SIRIUS He»s worried Dumbledore is trying to turn the students against the Ministry. 
HERMIONE Well, that would explain why Umbridge isn»t teaching us anything useful in Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
SIRIUS Exactly. The Ministry doesn»t want you trained in combat. 
HARRY What does he think Dumbledore is going to do, raise an army? 
59. 
SIRIUS That»s exactly what he»s worried about. Fudge is getting more paranoid about Dumbledore every day. 
There is a nervous silence in the room. 
HARRY What do you know about Umbridge? 
SIRIUS She»s a nasty piece of work. Apparently she hates part-humans. 
HARRY Could she be a Death Eater? 
SIRIUS The Order seriously doubts it. She»s no picnic, but she»s no Death Eater either. 
HARRY But she»s evil. 
SIRIUS The world isn»t split into the Order and the Death Eaters, Harry. 
Harry sits back, looking unsatisfied. 
SIRIUS As to your question about Hagrid, well, no one is really sure what happened to him, actually. He was supposed to be back a while ago. 
HERMIONE What? 
SIRIUS Dumbledore»s not worried about him, though. Hagrid»s tough. He»ll be all right.RON But if he was supposed to be back by now... 
60. 
61. 
SIRIUS Look, asking questions about him will only make it more obvious that he»s not back. 
Suddenly he glances with concern at the wall of the fireplace. 
SIRIUS Get out of here! 
His head vanishes. A split second later, a stubby-fingered hand appears in the fire, groping for Sirius»s head. 
The three of them run for their dormitories.

HERMIONE I cannot believe it! 
Harry and Ron glance at her. 
She slaps the paper down on the table. 
RON (reading headline) ≈Ministry Passes Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three: Dolores Umbridge Appointed Hogwarts High Inquisitor ? 
He looks at Harry and Hermione. 
RON What»s that mean? 
HERMIONE It says here that the High Inquisitor has the power to inspect all of the teachers. 
HARRY You»re kidding! 
HERMIONE That»s not all. The High Inquisitor also has the power to sack teachers as well. 
Fred and George march by. 
FRED So, seen the news have you? 
GEORGE Personally, I envy you three. 
RON Why»s that?GEORGE Umbridge is inspecting McGonagall in your period. That old toad won»t know what hit her. 
He looks at Fred wistfully. 
GEORGE Oh, to be a youth again, to experience the innocent glee of watching Umbridge be destroyed by the greatest Head of Gryffindor this century. 
FRED Well, we»ll expect a full report after.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY stands before her class. 
TRELAWNEY Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond! 
Umbridge smiles, toad-like. 
TRELAWNEY Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide. 
Ron and Harry open their books, while listening to Trelawney and Umbridge. 
UMBRIDGE And how long have you been at this post? 
TRELAWNEY Near to sixteen years I have been the guide to young seers possessed of the Inner sight. 
Umbridge makes a note.UMBRIDGE I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?TRELAWNEY I am. 
UMBRIDGE And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight? 
64. 
TRELAWNEY These things tend to skip...several...generations. 
UMBRIDGE Of course. 
She makes another note. 
UMBRIDGE Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me? 
Trelawney seems to swell with indignation. 
UMBRIDGE The Inner Eye does not See upon command! 
Umbridge smiles unpleasantly and makes an extensive note. Trelawney becomes agitated and looks around wildly. 
She steps up to Harry, who recoils slightly. 
TRELAWNEY My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please! 
Harry nervously hands his diary to her. She takes it with trembling fingers and gazes at it for only a moment. She drops it back to the table and gives a little scream. 
TRELAWNEY My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends! 
Harry looks at the page. 
HARRY (reading) ≈Dreamt I was at breakfast eating oatmeal ? 
Trelawney stares at him for a moment. Umbridge smirks in the background, making more notes. 
TRELAWNEY Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death? 
HARRY Er... 
65. 
TRELAWNEY Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others. 
She sweeps from Harry»s table. 
UMBRIDGE Well, if that»s the best you can do, Professor, I will be going.

Hermione, Ron, and Harry walk down the crowded streets of Hogsmead, avoiding the swarms of other students. 
HARRY Where are we going, Hermione? 
She leads them on confidently. They stop before a slightly seedy looking pub. 
HERMIONE There we are. 
RON ≈The Hog»s Head, Hermione? 
She leads them towards it. 
HERMIONE Come on, I»ll explain in a minute. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. HOG»S HEAD - DAY 
The three of them step into the pub. It is grimy and ill-lit. Shady witches and wizards sit uneasily in corners. 
Except for one corner by the front window, which is populated by Dean Thomas, Neville Longbottom, LAVENDER BROWN, Parvati and Padma Patil, Cho Chang, Luna Lovegood, KATIE BELL, ALICA SPINNET, Angelina Johnson, COLIN and DENNIS CRERVEY, ERNIE MACMILLAN, JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHELY, HANNAH ABBOTT, ANTHONY GOLDSTEIN, MICHAEL CORNER, TERRY BOOT, Ginny Weasley, Fred and George Weasley, LEE JORDAN, ZACHARIAS SMITH, SUSAN BONES and five others who Harry doesn»t know. 
Harry looks questioningly at Hermione. 
HARRY Hermione, what»s going on? 
HERMIONE These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with. 
She sits down. Harry and Ron follow. 
HARRY You mean about us teaching ourselves?NEVILLE Hey, Harry.HARRY Hey, Neville. 
LUNA (dreamily) It»s good to see that the horned snorkle-stacks haven»t gotten you yet, Harry. 
Harry looks confused for a moment. 
HARRY Uh...same to you, Luna. 
Hermione beats on the table to quiet everyone. 
HERMIONE Hi, everyone. I thought it would be good if we met and talked over how we wanted to teach ourselves Defense Against the Dark Arts. (pause) Because we need to learn it properly, not the rubbish Umbridge is doing. 
FRED Hear, hear!HERMIONE Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. 
66. 
67. 
Several people jump or wince in fear at the name. 
Hermione takes a shuddering breath, looking exhilarated. She looks at Harry. 
HARRY That»s the first time you»ve said his name. 
Hermione looks pleased. 
ZACHARIAS How do we know You-Know-Who»s really back?GEORGE Dumbledore believes he is. 
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLY You mean Dumbledore believes him. 
He nods in Harry»s direction. 
HERMIONE That»s true, but I think we»re drifting from the purpose-- 
HARRY It»s okay, Hermione. 
He looks at the crowd.HARRY I believe Voldemort»s back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore»s already told the school that. If you didn»t believe him you won»t believe anyone. 
There is a tense silence. 
HERMIONE Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we»ll need a teacher.NEVILLE But we»re all students. None of us has the experience to-- 
GINNY Someone here does. 
Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry. 
HARRY Me? 
MICHAEL CORNER I for one would like to know why Potter»s qualified and the rest of us aren»t.GINNY (defensively) Well, he»s only confronted You-Know- Who himself four times and lived to talk about it. 
SUSAN BONES One of the portraits said you»d killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore»s office. 
HARRY Uh...well, yeah, I did. 
LEE JORDAN Blimey, Harry... 
Half the crowd looks awestruck. 
LAVANDER BROWN Wow... 
FRED Can»t forget that he saved the Sorcerer»s Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year. 
The Patil sisters» eyes are wide with respect and astonishment. 
CHO And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament! 
There are mutters of agreement. 
RON Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn»t kill you! 
68. 
69. 
GINNY And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer. 
Hermione looks tremendously pleased. 
HERMIONE So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry? 
She holds up her hand. Ron, Ginny, Fred, George, Neville, Luna, Dean, Lee, Katie, Alica, Angelina, and Susan raise their hands. Then, after a moment, the rest raise theirs as well. 
HERMIONE Where are we going to meet? 
NEVILLE What about an unused classroom? 
HARRY That might work. I»ll look into that. 
HERMIONE Ok, good. 
She pulls a parchment out of her bag. 
HERMIONE I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here. 
Suddenly people look uncomfortable. 
ERNIE I don»t know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn»t like what we»re doing... 
HERMIONE Honestly, Ernie, do you think I»d just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted. 
Ernie looks more comfortable. Fred and George eagerly sign, as do the rest, even Cho»s friend MARIETTA signs. 
HERMIONE Also, what should we call ourselves? 
70. 
ANGELINA What about the Anti-Unbridhe League? 
HERMIONE We need something that doesn»t give away what we»re doing. 
GINNY I think it should be Dumbledore»s Army. 
There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her. 
HERMIONE Dumbledore»s Army it is, then. The D.A. for short. 
Fred and George stand, along with Lee. 
HERMIONE We»ll let you know when we»re going to meet. 
The meeting breaks up.

HARRY ≈By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately. 
Angelina is furious just looking at it again. 
ANGELINA She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it. 
Harry is extremely angry. 
HARRY Not only that, but what about the D.A.?

HARRY She knows.RON She can»t!HARRY Look, we don»t know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her. 
RON Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her. 
HERMIONE No, they couldn»t have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing. 
Harry stops pacing and grins at Hermione. 
HARRY What would we do without you, Hermione? 
She beams at him. 
Hedwig flutters in the open window and collapses to the floor. 
HARRY Hedwig! 
HERMIONE She»s hurt! 
Hedwig hoots softly. 
RON She doesn»t look very good.

McGonagall comes around the corner. 
MCGONAGALL Potter! 
He stops and turns to her. 
MCGONAGALL Where on earth are you going at this time of night? 
HARRY It»s Hedwig. I think she»s been attacked. 
MCGONAGALL What? 
She steps closer and peers closely at the hurt owl. 
MCGONAGALL Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. 
She looks at Harry. 
MCGONAGALL Where was she coming from? 
HARRY London. 
He gives her a significant look. She nods. 
MCGONAGALL Well, give her to me. I»ll run her down to Professor Grubby-Plank. 
Harry hands Hedwig to her. She takes the owl carefully. 
74. 
MCGONAGALL There you are. 
She straightens and moves down the hall, then stops. She turns to look at Harry. 
MCGONAGALL Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won»t you? 
HARRY Yes, Professor. 
MCGONAGALL Good. Now, off to bed.

HARRY Dobby! What are you doing here? 
DOBBY Dobby is cleaning, sir. 
He seemed to want to say something more. 
HARRY What is it, Dobby. 
DOBBY Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep. 
HARRY Don»t worry about it, Dobby. But I don»t think you can help me. 
Dobby»s ears droop. 
75. 
Harry collects his books, then stops. 
HARRY Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby. 
Dobby brightens instantly. 
HARRY I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge. 
Dobby leaps into the air and claps his hands. 
DOBBY Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter. 
HARRY That»s brilliant, Dobby! 
Dobby looks pleased. 
DOBBY Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter. 
Harry thinks for a moment. 
HARRY Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We»ll do it in a few months, before the holidays.

We glide over the landscape, the leaves gradually vanishing from the trees and snow begins to drift into sight as we pick up speed. We sail into the snowstorm over the Hogwarts Grounds, past Hagrid»s empty hut and into the Quidditch stadium. 
76. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - DAY 
Visibility is low. Players scatter everywhere. 
LEE JORDAN ...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle! 
Alica spins through the blizzard, trying desperately to see. Two shapes emerge from the snow. They are CRABBE and GOYLE, the Slytherin Beaters. Both of them take a swing at her. 
She twists completely around on her broom and the clubs swish harmlessly past. She pushes forward to the Slytherin goals and hurtles the quaffle. Blocked by the Slytherin Keeper! 
Below, in the stands, there is a groan from the Gryffindor side. From the Slytherins, there is a chant. 
SLYTHERINS Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King! 
Harry pulls up near to Ron, who is looking grimly sick to his stomach. 
HARRY Just ignore them, Ron! 
Ron does not acknowledge him. 
Several Slytherins, in possession of the Quaffle, bear down on the Gryffindor goals. They throw the quaffle. Ron dives and misses. 
A loud GONG sounds. Another groan from the Gryffindors. 
LEE JORDAN (v.o.) Another ten points to Slytherin. The score is now fifty-ten in favor of Slytherin. 
Malfoy pulls up on his broom near Ron as well. 
MALFOY I should thank you, Weasley. You»re definitely our best player! 
He laughs. 
77. 
Just then, the SNITCH blasts past Malfoy. He takes off in pursuit. Harry rockets after him at top speed, ignoring the bite of the snow against his face. 
He and Malfoy give chase, following the Snitch at top speed. Malfoy is still far closer than Harry. 
Then the Snitch BANKS SHARPLY. Both Draco and Harry turn with it, though now Harry has pulled even with Draco. They are inches from the Snitch. They reach with all of their might. 
Harry»s hand inches out in front of Draco and closes around the Snitch. Draco»s fingers scrabble on the back of Harry»s gloved hand. 
The crowd goes wild. Harry straightens, triumphant. 
Behind him, without warning, Crabbe emerges from the blizzard and CRACKS Harry across the back of the head with his Beater»s club. 
Harry slumps forward, and nose-dives into the pitch, rolling to a stop looking dazed. There is a groan of sympathy from the crowd. 
The other Gryffindors land and run to Harry. 
HERMIONE Harry, are you all right? 
He is helped to his feet by Fred and George. 
DRACO Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley»s neck, didn»t you? 
The Gryffindors ignore him. 
DRACO I»ve never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother! 
George tries to leap at Draco. Harry and Fred hold him back. 
DRACO And his pathetic loser of a father too! 
Fred attempts to charge Draco too. Other Gryffindors are restraining them now. 
78. 
DRACO But then, you like the Weasleys, don»t you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother! 
Harry turns and runs full out at Draco, who looks startled as Harry leaps at him, CRUSHING his fist into Draco»s jaw and knocking him to the ground. 
George breaks free of the Gryffindors and follows, hitting Malfoy too. 
Harry leaps onto Draco, hitting him again and again. 
MADAM HOOCH Impedimenta! 
She blasts Harry and George with her spell, knocking them off of Malfoy. 
McGonagall storms onto the pitch, Gryffindor scarf flapping wildly in the wind. 
MCGONAGALL (shouting) What on earth do you two think you»re doing? 
Harry rolls to his feet and goes for Malfoy again. Madam Hooch stands between them, her wand pointed directly at Harry. 
HOOCH Don»t make me stupify you, Potter! 
Harry stops, breathing hard, glaring daggers at Malfoy, who is curling in a ball, bleeding and crying. 
McGonagall comes right up to Harry and grabs him hard by the elbow. He finally turns his attention to her. She is pale and grim-faced. 
MCGONAGALL My office. Now. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. MCGONAGALL»S OFFICE - DAY 
George and Harry stand in front of McGonagall»s desk. She stands on the other side of it. 
MCGONAGALL In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display. 
HARRY Malfoy provoked us. 
MCGONAGALL Of course he wanted to provoke you! He»d just lost! 
She stares at both of them. 
MCGONAGALL I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now. 
The door opens and Umbridge steps into the room, smiling sickly. 
MCGONAGALL What is it, Dolores? 
UMBRIDGE I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two. 
MCGONAGALL You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office. 
She turns back to George and Harry. 
MCGONAGALL Now, I don»t care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I»m giving you both a week»s worth of detentions. 
UMBRIDGE I hardly think that»s an adequate punishment for this. 
She holds up a parchment. 
79. 
80. 
UMBRIDGE Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff. 
She turns to Harry and George. 
UMBRIDGE So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one»s twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well. 
Harry and George are stunned. 
HARRY Ban us...for life. 
UMBRIDGE Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter. 
She moves towards them. 
UMBRIDGE Ah, I»ll take your brooms as well. 
She confiscates the brooms too. 
UMBRIDGE Well, have a wonderful day. 
She sweeps from the office.

HAGRID I»ve fine, I tell yeh! 
82. 
RON Come off it, Hagrid! We»re not blind! 
HERMIONE Was it because of the giants? 
There is a silence. 
HAGRID Can» answer tha», I»m afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order. 
HARRY We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year.HAGRID Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp. 
RON A month? 
HAGRID O» course! Can» do magic, not with the Ministry followin» us all the way. Plus, giants aren»t fond o» wizards. Don» trust «em.

HAGRID Waited «till mornin» an» then marched righ» in. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

EXT. GIANT VALLEY - DAY 
Hagrid and Madam Maxime march into the camp, eyes fixed firmly on the GURG. Hagrid holds a large branch of EVERLASTING FIRE above his head. 
The GURG sits some distance away, sitting on a large stone seat, surrounded by other giant servants. 
THe giants stare at Hagrid and Maxime, flabbergasted. They slowly move aside for them to pass. 
83. 
Hagrid and Maxime bow before the GURG. 
HAGRID (v.o.) We gave «em a gift, jus» like Dumbledore said. Gave «em a branch o» Gubraithian fire, Everlasting Flame.(pause) Giants love magic, see, jus» not too fond o» wizards. Nuthin» a giant loves better than magic. 
The GURG smiles and hoists the branch of fire into the air. The giants roar and yell around them. 
Sticking the branch into the ground, the Gurg beckons Hagrid and Maxime foreward. 
HARRY (v.o.) What happened then? 
HAGRID (v.o.) We sat down, an» had a talk. Well, mostly they listened good. But there were good signs. (pause) Well, they did «till tha» night. Tha»s when everythin» went wrong. 
Hagrid and Maxime watch a great battle in the valley below them. They stand on the mountain side. 
HAGRID (v.o.) There were a coup. Nex» mornin» there were a new chief. 
Hagrid and Maxime walk back towards the New GURG the next day. This GURG is evil-looking and grinning at them nastily. 
HAGRID (v.o.) We went back ter see what we could do with this new chief. 
Two large bodyguards block the way to the new Gurg. They grab Hagrid. Maxime blasts them with spells from her wand. They drop Hagrid. 
84. 
There is an earth-shaking ROAR from all around them. Giants charge them from every direction. 
Maxime and Hagrid flee back up the mountain. 
HAGRID (v.o.) An» then things got even worse. Death Eaters arrived, an» the new chief were all happy ter be seein» them! 
Several DEATH EATERS, faces concealed behind their black cloaks, approach the new Gurg, who beckons them to speak. 
HAGRID (v.o.) We figured, jus» cause some o» the giants were favorin» You-Know-Who don»t mean all of «em were. The coup ha» driven the ol» chief»s supporters into some caves, so we wen» in after «em. 
Maxime and Hagrid walk into a dark cave, wands glowing. 
RON (awed) You went into caves looking for giants? 
HAGRID (v.o.) We foun» enough, an» they seemed interested--at first. Then the new chief»s lot raided the caves. Tweren»t many survivors, an» none o» them wanted anythin» to do with us after tha».

INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT 
Harry strolls into the ROOM OF REQUIREMENT, looking at the assembled group that makes up DUMBLEDORE»S ARMY. 
HARRY Glad to see all of you could find this place all right. 
NEVILLE Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff? 
Scattered around the room are many devices such as DARK DETECTORS and SNEAKASCOPES. 
HARRY Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we»ll be able to get to all of it before the end of term. 
He paces in front of them. 
HARRY You need to understand something before we start, though. Defending yourself from the Dark Arts has less to do with magical ability and more to do with thinking fast and a lot of luck. (pause) We»ll be doing Expelliarmus tonight, though hopefully we can move on to other things if we have time. 
ZACHARIAS Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year. 
RON Lockhart didn»t teach as much as prune himself. 
HARRY Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life. 
Zacharias falls silent. 
HARRY Right. Well, let»s split into pairs and give it a go.

NEVILLE Expelliarmus! 
Ron»s wand flips from his hand across the room. 
HARRY Well done, Neville! 
He shouts down the others. 
HARRY Look here, you lot! Neville»s really got the hang of this one. (to Neville) Go ahead again. 
Fred tosses Ron»s wand to him. Neville swirls his wand. 
NEVILLE Expelliarmus! 
Ron»s wand does it again. 
NEVILLE I did it! I did it! 
Harry claps him on the shoulder. 
HARRY Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day. 
He moves to the front of the room again. 
HARRY Okay, everyone. We»ve done a lot today, and I»ve seen some great improvement. That»s it for now. We»ll meet back here, same time next week!

INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - NIGHT 
We float along a dark corridor, inches from the floor. We come to another corridor and peer down it. It appears empty. 
A great PYTHON of a SNAKE slithers down the empty corridor. It slowly makes its way past many doors, until it reaches, at last, another, larger door. 
Behind it, an invisibility cloak falls to the floor in a SHIMMER OF SILVER. Mr. Weasley stands, drawing his wand. 
He fires a GOLDEN JINX at the snake. He misses. The snake strikes. Mr. Weasley screams. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT

Ron and Neville sprint to Harry»s bed. 
NEVILLE What»s wrong with him? 
88. 
Harry screams again. His eyes snap open and they are pure white, without pupils. He makes the bitting motion again, thrashing wildly. 
RON Get McGonagall! Go! 
Neville turns and runs out of the dorms. 

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. WEASLEY HOME - NIGHT 
Mrs. Weasley sits in her living room drinking a mug of tea. 
On the other side of the room stands the WEASLEY»S CLOCK. It chimes. She looks up, and then stands, moving closer to it. Mr. Weasley»s hand grinds over to the hour labeled ≈MORAL PERIL. 
The mug of tea SHATTERS on the floor. 
Mrs. Weasley clutches at her mouth in dread and horror.

_START OF NEW SCENE_

INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT 
Harry still struggles madly. 
RON Harry! HARRY! 
Harry blinks, and his eyes are normal. He comes to himself, only to let out a SHRIEK of BURNING AGONY. He clutches at his scar, eyes crossing and unable to focus. 
He rolls off the bed and onto the floor, where he writhes in abject pain. 
Neville returns with McGonagall. 
MCGONAGALL Potter! 
89. 
She runs to him, thrusting her candle into Neville»s hands. She falls to her knees next to Harry and tries to touch him. 
Her hand touches his skin and he yelps as if BURNT. She backs off. 
Harry vomits all over the floor. Taking a step back, McGonagall draws her wand, looking uncertain what she will do with it in any case. 
Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stops. Harry slumps over, unmoving. 
McGonagall is at his side in an instant. She rolls him over. His eyes are closed. 
MCGONAGALL Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please... 
Harry»s eyes open. He sits up, looking frantic. 
HARRY Mr. Weasley»s been attacked! 
MCGONAGALL You dreamed this, Potter? 
HARRY No, I saw it happen! I...I was there... 
Ron is looking pale. 
MCGONAGALL You»re sure this happened, Potter? 
HARRY (shouting) Yes! We»ve got to do something or he will die!MCGONAGALL We»re going to see the Headmaster, Potter. (pause) Weasley, you»d best come too.

INT. DUMBLEDORE»S OFFICE - NIGHT 
McGonagall opens the door leading to DUMBLEDORE»s OFFICE and leads Harry and Ron inside. 
90. 
Dumbledore looks up from where he is seated at his desk. 
DUMBLEDORE Professor McGonagall, and...ah... 
Dumbledore does not look at Harry, even acknowledge his presence. 
DUMBLEDORE What can I do for you? 
MCGONAGALL Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare...HARRY It wasn»t a nightmare! Well, I was asleep, but it wasn»t a normal dream. It was...well, real. I saw, well--Mr. Weasley has been attacked by a giant snake. 
Ron is looking very pale. 
DUMBLEDORE How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it? 
HARRY Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake»s perspective. 
DUMBLEDORE Is Arthur seriously injured? 
HARRY Yes! 
Dumbledore stands and looks up at the portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts. Two of them are watching the proceedings. 
DUMBLEDORE You were listening? 
EVERARD Naturally.DUMBLEDORE Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people. 
91. 
Everard and Dilys move out of their frames and do not return. 
DUMBLEDORE Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them. 
He motions for all of them to sit. 
They sit. Dumbledore moves to Fawkes. 
DUMBLEDORE Fawkes, we will need a warning. 
The PHOENIX vanishes in a blast of fire. 
Dumbledore sits back at his desk and pulls a SILVERY, WHIRRING instrument to him. It emits some smoke that forms itself into the shape of a SERPENT, then splits in two. 
The two serpents coil around each other. 
DUMBLEDORE Naturally, naturally. (pause) But in essence divided? 
Harry and Ron exchange confused looks. 
Everard returns to his portrait. 
DUMBLEDORE What news?EVERARD I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn»t look good. Covered in blood... 
Dilys returns to her portrait at this time. 
DILYS Dumbledore, I»ve just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad. 
DUMBLEDORE Good.(to McGonagall) 
(MORE) 
92. 
DUMBLEDORE (cont'd) 
Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken. 
She nods and departs. 
Dumbledore again turns to the portraits hanging on the wall. 
DUMBLEDORE Phineas. 
PHINEAS BLACK opens his eyes and stares at Dumbledore. 
DUMBLEDORE Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while. 
PHINEAS It»s late, Dumbledore... 
Dumbledore stares at him. 
PHINEAS I»m going, I»m going... 
He vanishes. 
Dumbledore takes a black pot and taps it with his wand. 
DUMBLEDORE ≈Portus. 
McGonagall returns with Ginny, Fred, and George in tow. 
GINNY Harry, what»s happening-- 
DUMBLEDORE Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order. He is alive and arrived at St. Mungo»s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries only moments ago. 
He picks up the pot and steps around the desk. 
DUMBLEDORE We, however, are going to Sirius»s house until the morning. We»re merely waiting for Phineas to return. 
A flash of flames appears over Fawkes» perch. A single feather floats to the ground. 
DUMBLEDORE Fawkes»s warning. Umbridge knows you»re out of bed. Minerva, head her off. Tell her anything you can think of. 
McGonagall departs again. 
Phineas returns to his portrait. 
PHINEAS He says he»d be delighted. 
Dumbledore beckons everyone over to him. 
DUMBLEDORE We»re going by Portkey. 
They all grab the pot, and VANISH.

INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT 
They reappear in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. Sirius hurries in. 
SIRIUS There you are. 
He looks at Dumbledore, but the Headmaster had all ready disapperated. 
GINNY We»ve got to go to St. Mungo»s. 
SIRIUS No, you can»t. 
GEORGE We can go where we please. 
SIRIUS We can»t go yet. It would look to suspicious if you lot showed up fifteen minutes after Arthur arrives because Harry»s been seeing visions of things happening hundreds of miles from Hogwarts. 
93. 
94. 
George, livid with rage and fear, shoves his face near Sirius»s. 
GEORGE That»s our father out there dying! 
SIRIUS I can»t let you leave. I»m sorry. 
He slowly draws his wand, holding it loosely at his side. The point was not lost to anyone. 
FRED You don»t even care! You wouldn»t even understand! 
Sirius stares at him incredulously. 
SIRIUS I was part of the first Order. I lost my best friends to You-Know- Who. 
His eyes flick to Harry. 
SIRIUS He»s all I have left of them. Believe me, I don»t want Arthur to die.(pause) But there are some things worth dying for! 
Fred and George look very much cowed by the haunted look in Sirius»s eyes. 
Finally, they sink into chairs around the table. George puts his head in his hands. Fred simply stares at the wall. Ginny is weeping softly. Ron puts his arm around her. 
Harry sits away from them, by himself.

Harry gets up and walks wearily out into the hall. He stands back, watching, as the Weasleys are reunited in the hall. 
Yet Harry is forgotten in the background. He stands apart from them, looking on, an intruder to their grief. 
Finally they separate.MRS. WEASLEY Your father»s alive. He»s going to make it. 
There is relief evident on all of their faces.

SIRIUS You can tell me, Harry. 
HARRY When I saw the attack, well, I was the snake.SIRIUS What? 
HARRY I felt the fangs like they were mine, saw through the snake»s eyes like they were mine... 
Sirius looks concerned. 
96. 
HARRY I think I might be going mad. 
There is a horrible silence. Sirius looks uncomfortable. 
SIRIUS Nonsense. You»re just tired. You»ve had a rough night. 
HARRY But what if there»s a snake inside me? 
SIRIUS You»ve told Dumbledore this? (off Harry»s nod) Then there»s nothing to worry about.

INT. WARD - DAY 
There are three patients in the ward. Arthur lies in the farthest bed by the window, propped up on several pillows and reading the paper. 
MR. WEASLEY Hullo, everyone! 
Mrs. Weasley bends down and kisses Arthur. 
MRS. WEASLEY How are you, dear? 
ARTHUR I am absolutely fine. If they could take the bandages off, I»d walk out of here in a jiffy. 
He hugs Ginny with his good arm. 
FRED How come they haven»t taken them off, then?ARTHUR Oh, I start bleeding like mad. The snake had some strange poison in it. Keeps the wounds open. But they»ll find a cure, don»t you doubt. 
George leans in close.GEORGE What were you doing when it happened, dad? 
MR. WEASLEY That»s my own business. 
98. 
FRED You were guarding it, weren»t you? This weapon thing? 
MRS. WEASLEY That»s enough!

MRS. WEASLEY All of you, out, if you please. 
They turn and leave. Mr Weasley calls Harry back. 
ARTHUR Harry, stay a moment. 
Harry returns to the bed. 
ARTHUR I never thanked you properly.

MOODY He probably sent it as a lookout. See what he»s up against. That»s the closest he»s ever gotten to it. (pause) So, Potter says he saw the whole thing? 
MRS. WEASLEY Yes. You know, Dumbledore seems like he»s been waiting for something like this to happen. When I spoke to him this morning, he seemed very worried about Harry. 
MOODY He should be. I mean, if You-Know- Who is really possessing him... 
Moody trails off.

Harry straightens and looks at the others huddled outside the door. They are staring at him in unmistakable fear. 
Harry looks away from them. There is a silence. 
LOCKHART Hullo. 
They turn. 
HERMIONE Professor Lockhart! 
Lockhart looks puzzled. 
LOCKHART Professor? Me? Did I really? Well, I expect I was hopeless at it! 
He rubs his hands together briskly. 
LOCKHART Now, I»ll expect all of you will be wanting my autograph? 
HARRY Uh, sure... 
Just then, a HEALER emerges from a DOUBLE-DOOR nearby. 
100. 
HEALER Ah, there you went, Gildroy. 
She comes up to them and gently takes his elbow. 
HEALER He keeps wandering off, handing out autographs, don»t you know? It»s a good sign toward recovering his memory, the poor dear. 
RON Yeah, sorry about that, mate. 
Lockhart peers at him.LOCKHART Have we met?RON Yeah, it was my wand that backfired on you. 
HEALER Was it? What a coincidence!

She bustles away. 
MRS. LONGBOTTOM Come along, Neville. 
Harry and the others turn. 
RON Hey, Neville! 
Neville turns beet-red, and looks away. 
His GRANDMOTHER looks at the three of them.

MRS. LONGBOTTOM Friends of yours, Neville? (pause) Ah, yes, Harry Potter. Good to meet you, finally. And a Weasley. 
She turns to HermioneMRS. LONGBOTTOM And you must be Miss Granger. Neville»s mentioned you. 
RON Who»re you visiting, Neville? 
Mrs. Longbottom turns to Neville. 
MRS. LONGBOTTOM You haven»t told them? 
HERMIONE Told us what? 
MRS. LONGBOTTOM Neville»s dear parents were tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who before he disappeared. Aurors, you know, very well respected. 
Just then, ALICE LONGBOTTOM, Neville»s mother, emerges from behind the parition. 
She beckons tentatively to Neville, who goes to her. 
She gently, almost reverently, hands him a CANDY WRAPPER. 
MRS. LONGBOTTOM Another one, Alice? All right, come on, Neville. 
Neville is still staring at his mother, who smiles at him, then disappears again. 
Neville turns, locks eyes with Harry, and departs. As he goes, he slips the wrapper into his pocket, as if it were his most treasured possession. 
Hermione and Ron watch him.

He doesn»t answer, but marches up the stairs and shuts himself in his bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Harry begins to pack his trunk determinedly. 
PHINEAS Running away, are we? 
He turns to the portrait of Phineas. 
HARRY I have to.PHINEAS You know, I thought Gryffindors had to be brave.HARRY I won»t hurt anybody else. 
PHINEAS I see. You are running away out of nobility. You know, that»s why I hated teaching. Young people always think they know what»s best, as if no one else could possibly understand things better. 
Harry moves to a window and opens it, leaning out. 
PHINEAS I»ve brought a message from Dumbledore. 
Harry stops and looks at him. 
HARRY What is it? 
103. 
PHINEAS Dumbledore says, «Stay where you are.» 
HARRY That»s it? Stay there while the grown-ups sort things out? 
PHINEAS When in all your life has listening to Dumbledore ever led you into trouble? Whatever his reasons, he has your best interests at heart, Potter. 
Phineas moves off the portrait frame and vanishes. 
HARRY Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing! 
He tips his trunk over in anger and sits down on the bed. 
There is a knock on the door. 
Ginny walks in, looking determined. 
HARRY Get out! 
GINNY No. 
HARRY Ginny, I»m dangerous. You can»t be around me. GINNY Did you forget that I»ve been possessed by You-Know-Who before? 
Harry falls silent, looking cowed. 
HARRY I forgot. 
GINNY Lucky you. Anyway, that»s what I wanted to talk to you about. (pause) Can you remember everything you»ve done this year? There aren»t any blank spots in your memory? 
104. 
HARRY No, I don»t think so. 
GINNY Then You-Know-Who has never possessed you, Harry. 
She sits down on the bed next to him. 
GINNY I don»t know what»s going on with you right now, but possession»s not one of them. You»re not dangerous. 
She smiles at him. Finally, he smiles back. 
HARRY (mumbling) Thanks, Ginny. 
GINNY Don»t mention it. 
She hops off the bed and departs the room. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Harry wanders into the kitchen and opens the REFRIGERATOR. Sirius enters. 
SIRIUS Harry, have you seen Kreacher? I haven»t seen him for days now. 
HARRY Haven»t seen him. 
SIRIUS Oh well. Maybe he»s crawled up into the air ducts and died...mustn»t get my hopes up though. 
The back door is shoved open and Snape enters. 
SNAPE Potter, excellent. I»d like a word. 
He marches over to the table and sits. 
SNAPE Sit, Potter. 
SIRIUS You know, I don»t like people giving orders in my house. 
SNAPE How unfortunate for you. Now kindly get out. My instructions from Dumbledore are to talk with Potter alone. 
SIRIUS I»m his godfather. I think I»ll stay. 
Snape curls his lip in anger but keeps quiet. 
SNAPE Very well, then. I know how you like to pretend you»re useful. 
Sirius stiffens, but ignores the jab. 
SNAPE It is the Headmaster»s wish that I teach you Occlumency, Potter. 
HARRY What»s that? 
Snape sneers. 
SNAPE Occlumency. It is an ancient form of magic that allows you to defend your mind from external intrusion. (pause) We begin at six-o-clock on Monday, Potter. 
Snape stands. 
SNAPE Well, unlike Sirius here, I don»t have unlimited leisure time. 
SIRUS Just a second, Snape. If I hear that you»re using this to give Harry a hard time, you»ll have me to answer to. 
Snape sneers again. 
105. 
106. 
SNAPE How touching. Yet Potter is incredibly like his father. Criticism simply bounces off of him. 
Sirius stands and grabs Snape by the shoulders and roughly shoves him into the wall. He glares at Snape. 
SIRIUS I»ve warned you, Snivellus. Dumbledore may think you»ve reformed, but I know better... 
Snape pushes him out of the way. 
SNAPE Touch me one more time, Black, and you won»t touch anything again. 
He sweeps back to the door and departs. 
EXT. H0GWARTS - DAY 
We sail through another snowstorm back to Hogwarts, passing the grounds and sliding through an open window. 
INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY 
Harry makes his way along the hallway. 
Suddenly Cho comes around the corner. She skids to an abrupt halt, blushing slightly. 
CHO Hi, Harry.HARRY Hi. 
There is an awkward silence. 
CHO Er...bye then. 
She starts to walk by.HARRY Hey Cho! 
She turns to him. 
107. 
HARRY Well, uh, Valentine»s Day is the same day as our next Hogsmead visit. 
She blushes harder. 
HARRY Well, uh, would you like to, you know, go with me? 
CHO Sure! 
HARRY Cool. 
She smiles at him and walks away. 
INT. SNAPE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Harry enters SNAPE»S OFFICE. Snape sits behind his desk, next to a PENSIVE. 
SNAPE Sit, Potter. 
Harry does so. 
SNAPE As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency. 
HARRY What»s that, Professor? 
SNAPE Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others. 
HARRY Voldemort can read minds? 
SNAPE As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone (MORE) wall, Potter. 
108. 
SNAPE (cont'd) 
The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered. 
HARRY So he could read our minds right now? 
SNAPE Eye contact is normally required for Legilimency to work. In your case, however, things are somewhat different. Your scar has forged a connection between you and the Dark Lord.(pause) When your mind is most relaxed, such as during sleep, you receive the Dark Lord»s thoughts and feelings. The Headmaster believes that it is inadvisable for this to continue. 
HARRY But hasn»t it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley»s life, didn»t it?SNAPE Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions. 
Snape stands and pulls out his wand. Harry flinches, ever so slightly. But Snape merely puts it to his head and draws a GLOWING STRING of memory from his head and drops it into the Pensive. 
SNAPE Wand out, Potter. 
Harry draws his wand.SNAPE You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me. 
109. 
HARRY What are you going to do? 
SNAPE I am going to break into your mind. (pause) Legimens! 
The spell hits Harry, who staggers backward, grimacing.

Harry»s face is contorted with rage. 
HARRY NO! 
A spell fires from his wand. Snape dodges it. Gasping, Harry falls to his knees. 
SNAPE Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind. 
Harry climbs to his feet. 
SNAPE Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon your emotions. Legilimens! 
Harry staggers again. 
110. 
INT. DURSLEYS HOME - DAY 
Uncle Vernon nails the letterbox closed... 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - DAY 
Harry skids to a stop and looks down a dark hallway. Mr. Weasley stops as well, and glances back at Harry. 
MR. WEASLEY Come on, Harry! 
HARRY I've been there before... 
Mr. WEASLEY looks nervous, then grabs Harry's robes and drag him along. 
MR. WEASLEY Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely... 
INT. SNAPE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Snape lowers his wand, breaking the spell. 
SNAPE What was that? 
Harry looks stunned. 
HARRY I»ve just realized... 
Snape is staring at him, agitated. 
SNAPE Realized what, Potter? 
Harry looks at Snape suddenly. 
HARRY What»s in the Department of Mysteries, sir? 
There is a stunned silence. Snape regards Harry with suspicion. 
SNAPE What did you say? 
111. 
HARRY That corridor, I»ve been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I»m sure of it. 
Snape comes around the desk. He is deathly quiet, always a bad sign. 
SNAPE There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you. 
There is a horrifying SCREAM that ECHOS through the castle. 
Snape and Harry stare at the ceiling. Snape glances at Harry, then hefts his wand and sweeps from the office. Harry follows. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT 
There is a huge crowd of students standing at the top of the stairs leading down into the entry hall. 
There is another UNEARTHLY WAIL. 
Harry pushes his way through the crowd until he can see. 
Trelawney stands at the bottom of the stairs, looking crazed and turning in circles, her wand out and clutched in her hand. 
TRELAWNEY (shrieking) You cannot sack me! 
UMBRIDGE I can do whatever I wish! 
TRELAWNEY This is my home! 
Umbridge is grinning evilly. 
UMBRIDGE Not anymore. 
She points at the door with a stubby finger. 
112. 
UMBRIDGE Now remove yourself from this castle! 
DUMBLEDORE She will not be leaving. 
Behind Umbridge, the crowd parts slowly, and Dumbledore moves down the steps. 
UMBRIDGE I have the authority, Headmaster! 
DUMBLEDORE Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However... 
He looks at Trelawney, who stands alone in the entry hall, smiling at Dumbledore through her tears. 
DUMBLEDORE ...You cannot send them from this castle. That is still my decision. Professor Trelawney will remain here. 
Umbridge turns to him, furious. 
UMBRIDGE And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher. 
DUMBLEDORE Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor for good Professor Trelawney already. As you know... 
Umbridge is looking mutinous. 
DUMBLEDORE ...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough. 
The GREAT OAKEN doors leading to the grounds swing open, revealing an EBONY-SKINNED CENTAUR. It is FIRENZE, who saved Harry in his first year. 
DUMBLEDORE This is Firenze. 
113. 
Umbridge is thunderstruck. 
INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are huddled around a table. 
RON So you»re saying this weapon You- Know-Who»s after is in the Department of Mysteries? 
HARRY It»s got to be. 
HERMIONE That»s got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested. 
HARRY Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order»s guarding! 
RON But why the Department of Mysteries?HERMIONE It makes perfect sense, Ron. It»s got to be something the Ministry»s been developing. Something top secret. 
Harry nods in agreement. 
Hermione picks up a copy of the Daily Prophet grimly. 
HERMIONE Look at this. There»s been a mass escape from Azkaban. 
RON Bloody hell! 
Harry stares at the front page picture of ten witches and wizards. 
HARRY They»re all Death Eaters! 
114. 
Hermione nods fearfully. 
HERMIONE Yes. 
Harry grits his teeth.HARRY Voldemort. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. HOGSMEAD - DAY 
The sun rises over Hogwarts as Harry, Ron, and Hermione stroll down the main street of Hogsmead. 
Cho quickly finds Harry. 
CHO Hi, Harry! 
Harry grins sheepishly at her, avoiding looking at Ron. 
HERMIONE Have fun, Harry. Meet me in The Three Broomsticks after. There»s something you need to do. 
HARRY Ok. 
He goes to Cho, and they leave together. 
INT. MADAM PUDDIFOOT»S - DAY 
Outside, it rains. 
Harry and Cho sit awkwardly opposite each other at a small table. Valentine»s Day decorations accost the eyes at every turn. 
CHO You know, Cedric and I came here last year. Before... 
Harry looks away, and sees several couples kissing. He looks away. 
115. 
CHO I--I»ve been meaning to ask you for ages...but...I mean... 
Harry looks at her. She is beginning to tear up. 
HARRY What? 
CHO Did--did Cedric say anything about me before he...he--died? 
HARRY Oh. Uh, no, there wasn»t really much time... 
Cho bursts into tears. Harry tries to console her. 
HARRY Look, maybe we should talk about something else... 
CHO I thought you»d want to talk about it! I thought you»d understand! 
She stands up so suddenly the table rattles. The teashop has gone deathly still. Everyone watches them. 
CHO See you around, Harry. 
She walks out. 
Harry stands and runs after her. 
EXT. HOGSMEAD - DAY 
Harry staggers into the rain, looking around frantically. But Cho has disappeared. 
Getting wetter by the minute, he gives up and slowly makes his way over to the Three Broomsticks. 
INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS - DAY 
He enters and sees Hermione. She»s sitting in a booth with Luna and RITA SKEETER, a reporter. 
Harry sits down. 
HARRY What»s this all about? 
RITA That»s what Little Miss Perfect was about to tell us. 
Harry glances at Hermione. 
HERMIONE Right, well, I figured that with all of the negative press out about Harry, he should have a chance to defend himself. (pause) All of the details. What happened last summer. The truth about Sirius Black and Voldemort, not to mention the names of all the Death Eaters still on the loose. 
Rita leans across the table. 
RITA The Prophet will never publish that. Goes against the public mood. 
HERMIONE Well, it doesn»t matter. We»ve found a publisher for the article. 
RITA Who? 
Luna looks away from the window. 
LUNA My father. He»s the editor of The Quibbler. 
Rita laughs out loud.RITA The Quibbler? (to Hermione) You think people will take Harry Potter seriously if he»s published in the Quibbler? It»s nothing but a conspiracy theory, cock-and-bull story tabloid! 
116. 
117. 
HERMIONE Some won»t believe Harry, that»s true. But every person we do convince is one more ally. 
Rita shrugs, and pulls her quill from her bag. 
HERMIONE So, Harry. Ready to tell the public the truth?HARRY Yeah, I guess so. 
Hermione sits back and sips her drink. 
HERMIONE Fire away, Rita. 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY 
The snow on the ground has melted. The sky is clear and the sun shines brightly. Spring has come. 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
Harry, Ron and Hermione sit at the Gryffindor table eating breakfast. 
An owl drops a letter on Harry»s plate. Hermione opens it and pulls out a copy of the Quibbler. 
Harry»s smiling face grins at them from the front cover. 
HERMIONE Look, Harry! It»s your article! 
Then, a dozen more owls drop letters on Harry. He covers his head as their rain around him. 
HARRY What on earth? 
Hermione beams at him.HERMIONE Fan mail, Harry! Responses to the article. 
UMBRIDGE Which article is that, dear? 
118. 
Umbridge had appeared at their table, smiling toad-like. 
HARRY I have just published an article telling the real story about what happened last June. 
Umbridge instantly turns an ugly shade of purple in her rage. 
UMBRIDGE Where is this article? 
Hermione hands her the Quibbler. 
UMBRIDGE Right, I will confiscate this. Anyone found in possession of this magazine will be expelled. 
She stalks off. 
Hermione giggles in triumph. 
HARRY What? 
HERMIONE She»s done it to herself. Banning the article will only make people want to read it more! 
INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT 
Harry stands before the D.A. again. 
HARRY We»ve been doing so well, I thought we»d work on some defensive blocking spells tonight. 
INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT 
Wands wave and spells fly through the air. Harry paces through the students.HARRY That was really good. 
With a CRACK, Dobby appears. 
119. 
DOBBY Mr. Harry Potter! 
He looks absolutely frantic. Harry turns to him. 
HARRY What is it, Dobby? 
The House-Elf has gone quiet, clamping his hands over his mouth. 
DOBBY She-- 
He stopped, terrified.HARRY Who, Dobby? 
Dobby shakes his head.HARRY Is it Umbridge? 
Dobby nods. Harry looks up, horrified. 
Dobby forces his arms down and takes a breath. 
DOBBY She knows, Harry Potter. She»s coming! 
Harry opens the door with a wave of his wand. 
HARRY Get out of here! Now! 
There is a mad rush to the door. Harry ushers them all out safely, and exits. 
INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Harry pelts up a hallway. 
He is hit in the back with a spell and falls to the ground. 
Malfoy leaps from behind a statue. 
DRACO Got you, Potter. (pause) Over here, Professor! I»ve got one! 
120. 
Umbridge hurries over.UMBRIDGE It»s him. Well done, Draco! (to Harry) On your feet, Potter. We»re going to see the Headmaster! 
She turns to Draco. 
UMBRIDGE Search everywhere for the others, Draco. Round them all up. Check everywhere, bathrooms, the library, empty classrooms. We must find them! 
Draco nods and hurries off. 
INT. DUMBLEDORE»S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Umbridge shoves Harry into Dumbledore»s office, which is filled with people. McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge, Kingsley Shacklebolt, another Auror, and Percy Weasley. 
DUMBLEDORE You may be High Inquisitor of this school, Professor Umbridge, but kindly do not manhandle my students. 
Fudge looks pleased. He claps his hands and rubs them excitedly. 
FUDGE Well, well, well, Mr. Potter! I expect you know why you»re here? 
Harry glances at Dumbledore. The Headmaster shakes his head, ever so slightly. 
HARRY Not really, no. 
FUDGE You don»t? You haven»t broken any school rules? 
HARRY School rules? No. 
121. 
FUDGE Or Ministerial Decrees? 
HARRY Not that I know of. 
Umbridge opens the door again, leading Marietta, Cho»s friend, into the room. She has been crying, and her face is covered in PIMPLES forming the word ≈SNEAK. 
UMBRIDGE I»m afraid the poor girl is unable to speak. But I shall tell you what has transpired. (pause) Shortly after dinner she came to me and said that if I went to the Room of Requirement I would find an illegally-formed student group. (pause) It was at that time that this hex took affect. 
She gestures to Marietta»s face. 
UMBRIDGE Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog»s Head to start an illegal group-- 
DUMBLEDORE I»m not sure that»s true, Professor.UMBRIDGE I»m sorry?DUMBLEDORE In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal. 
UMBRIDGE But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced. 
DUMBLEDORE Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then? 
122. 
UMBRIDGE I have a witness right here! 
DUMBLEDORE Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight.UMBRIDGE Let»s ask her, shall we? 
She turns to Marietta, who is staring at the wall. 
UMBRIDGE You can shake your head for an answer, dear. Now, have there been more meetings? 
Slowly, still staring at the wall, Marietta shakes her head. 
UMBRIDGE What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?DUMBLEDORE I would think that she was saying there have been no other meetings. Would that be correct? 
She nods. 
UMBRIDGE But what about Potter? He was the leader, and has been-- 
To Umbridge»s astonishment, Marietta is shaking her head yet again. 
UMBRIDGE Why are you shaking your head, girl? 
MCGONAGALL It usually means «no,» Dolores. 
Umbridge grabs Marietta by the cloak and shakes her roughly. 
Dumbledore stands, and there is anger in his voice. He draws his wand and points it at Umbridge. 
123. 
DUMBLEDORE Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge. 
She laughs, softly, and lets Marietta go. 
UMBRIDGE My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself. 
FUDGE Well, what about the meeting tonight? 
UMBRIDGE Right. Of course. Well, we proceeded down to the Room and entered. (pause) We caught Potter just outside. But it doesn»t matter. We»ve found all of their names. 
She pulls the roster list Hermione had made up from her pocket. Harry gaps at it in horror. 
Fudge gapes at it as well. He snatches it out of Umbridge»s hands. He looks up, an expression of twisted delight on his face. 
FUDGE So, Dumbledore, you»ve been behind this whole thing. 
He hands the paper to Dumbledore, who looks at it. He seems suddenly at a loss for words. 
FUDGE (harsh whisper) Dumbledore»s Army. 
Dumbledore smiles pleasantly and spreads his hands widely. 
DUMBLEDORE Well, Minister. You»ve caught me. 
FUDGE This has all been your doing! You»ve been recruiting students for your army! 
124. 
DUMBLEDORE Quite correct, Cornelius. 
FUDGE I knew it! I KNEW it! You»ve been plotting against me all this time! 
DUMBLEDORE (pleasantly) That»s right. 
FUDGE This is too good to be true! 
Harry turns to Dumbledore in horror. 
HARRY Professor, no! 
DUMBLEDORE Quiet, Harry! 
FUDGE Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you»ll be coming with us to the Ministry-- 
DUMBLEDORE Ah, yes. I was wondering when we»d hit that little snag. 
FUDGE I see no snag, Dumbledore. 
DUMBLEDORE But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would «come quietly.» 
FUDGE Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?DUMBLEDORE Precisely. You see, I have absolutely no intention of going to Azkaban. 
The Auror next to Kingsley slowly moves his hand towards his pocket. 
DUMBLEDORE Don»t be silly, Hawkes. Leave the wand there. 
125. 
The man stops. 
FUDGE You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?DUMBLEDORE Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I»m afraid I shall have to hurt you. 
In one motion, all of them draw their wands. Harry dives for cover. 
Dumbledore is fastest. There is an instant of BLINDING LIGHT as spells blast in all directions. A spell strikes Dumbledore»s desk with a BANG, and explodes. Dust fills the room. 
There is a shout and some SCUFFLING OF FEET, another BANG, and silence. 
Harry blinks and stands as the dust settles. Dumbledore hasn»t moved. Fudge, the Auror, Dolores, Kingsley, and Percy are all laying on the floor, unconscious. 
Dumbledore»s desk has been broken in half, and all of the tables overturned. 
He moves swiftly to McGonagall, Harry, and Marietta. 
DUMBLEDORE Are you all right? 
McGonagall is standing, dusting herself off. 
MCGONAGALL Yes, we»re fine. (pause) Oh, where will you go, Albus? 
DUMBLEDORE I»m not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts. 
Harry moves to Dumbledore»s side. 
HARRY I»m so sorry, Professor! 
126. 
Dumbledore smiles at him. 
DUMBLEDORE It»s fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you. 
He grips Harry»s shoulder. 
DUMBLEDORE Close your mind! You will understand, in time. 
Fudge is stirring. 
DUMBLEDORE Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk. 
They do so. He moves to Fawkes. 
Fudge opens his eyes. Dumbledore grabs onto Fawkes» tail, and the two VANISH in a BLAST of FIRE. 
FUDGE Find him! 
Umbridge, Percy, Kingsley, the auror, and Fudge race from the office. 
McGonagall ushers Harry and Marietta out of the office. 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
Harry sits next to Ron and Hermione. 
Umbridge stands up from the staff table, holding a parchment. 
UMBRIDGE ≈By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
She looks over them all smugly. 
127. 
UMBRIDGE My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school. 
Harry glares at her. 
UMBRIDGE Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the «old punishments.» I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn»t. 
Filch stands at the back of the hall, grinning like a kid at Christmas. 
EXT. HOGWARTS COURTYARD - DAY 
Harry, Hermione, and Ron head towards the Hogwarts Grounds. Ron is dressed in his Quidditch robes. 
HARRY Are you sure you can»t? Hagrid said it was important. 
RON No way. Quidditch practice. If I don»t show up, Angelina»ll go mad. 
They part ways. 
EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY 
Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid march through the FORBIDDEN FOREST. 
HERMIONE Hagrid...we»ve been walking for a good hour.HAGRID Its jus» up ahead, here. 
HARRY Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please? 
128. 
HAGRID All righ». Well, I»m showin» yeh this, because tha» Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can» last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney.HERMIONE We won»t let her! 
HAGRID Bah. S»not the end o» the world. If I do, I»ll go help Dumbledore. Grea» man... (pause) Anyway, I woudn» tell yeh «cept for tha». I can» leave withou» makin» arraingmen»s, see? (pause) I»ll need all o» yer help. 
HERMIONE Of course we»ll help. 
Hagrid took a great sniff and clapped her on the back, causing her to stumble slightly. 
HAGRID Knew yeh»d say yes! 
He pauses and glances at them. 
HAGRID Okay, real quiet like from here on. 
They creep down the path until Hagrid straightens and smiles. 
HAGRID There we are! 
There is a huge body laying on the ground before them. It is a giant. 
HERMIONE Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come! 
Hagrid looks uncomfortable. 
HAGRID None o» them did, Hermione! I didn» have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn» leave «im! 
129. 
HERMIONE Oh, why, Hagrid? Why? 
HAGRID He»s me brother! 
There is a silence in the forest. 
HAGRID Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had «im afore she died. (pause) I though» I could bring «im back here an» train «im up a bit. Teach «im a bit o» manners. 
Hermione is distraught. Harry is nervous. Hagrid moves towards his half-brother. 
HAGRID Here. I»ll introduce yeh to Grawp! 
He tosses a rock at GRAWP. It bounces off his head. The giant awakes, and slowly stands to his full FIFTEEN-FOOT height. 
HAGRID Yeh all righ», Grawp? 
Grawp gives a low roar. 
HAGRID Look wha» I brough» yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an» all. We «ave Harry Potter here, see? An» over here is Hermy. 
Grawp stops roaring and simply looks at them. Then he reaches out towards Hermione.GRAWP Hermy! 
Harry grabs her and pulls her behind a tree as the huge fists close around the air. Hagrid hits Grawp with a large stick. 
HAGRID Bad Grawpy! Bad boy! 
Grawp roars in pain. 
HAGRID We don» attack our friends, Grawpy! 
130. 
Grawp roars again. Hagrid, Hermione, and Harry flee the scene. 
HAGRID See, he don» know any better. 
Harry glares at him. 
HAGRID Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an» talk to «im. Give «im a bit o» company. 
Suddenly Hagrid stops and looks around. From the undergrowth, a large number of CENTAURS have appeared. 
HAGRID Oh blimey... 
BANE steps into the clearing. 
BANE I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar. 
HAGRID S»not up to you who comes and goes in this forest. 
BANE You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at Hogwarts. 
HAGRID Stopped yeh from committin» murder, yeh mean! 
BANE Our ways are not yours, Hagrid. And now you bring that monster here...our patience with it wanes swiftly. 
HAGRID Well, you»ll tolerate «im as long as he»s here! 
The Centaurs paw the ground in agitation. 
131. 
BANE We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit. 
The centaurs vanish into the undergrowth again. 
INT. MCGONAGALL»S OFFICE - DAY 
Harry enters McGonagall»s office. She sits behind her desk. Umbridge sits in the corner with a note pad. 
MCGONAGALL Please sit, Potter. 
He sits. 
MCGONAGALL You»re here to have a talk with me about your career thoughts, Potter. We do this so we can begin to aim your courses over the next two years to prepare you for that career. 
HARRY Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about being an Auror. 
MCGONAGALL Auror. Interesting, Potter. You»ll need top grades for that. Challenging career path, but not unrewarding.UMBRIDGE Hem hem. 
MCGONAGALL Now then, Potter, you»ll need to concentrate on Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms to adequately prepare yourself for the general Auror requirements. 
UMBRIDGE Hem hem. 
132. 
MCGONAGALL May I offer you a cough drop, Professor Umbridge? 
UMBRIDGE Oh, no thank you, Minerva. Actually, I was just wondering if Potter has the proper temperament to be an Auror. 
MCGONAGALL Were you indeed. 
She turns back to Harry. 
MCGONAGALL If you»re serious in this ambition, Potter, I would recommend concentrating on bringing your Potions and Charms grades up before your O.W.L.s. I daresay you»ve got enough time if you apply yourself. Lord knows you»ve consistently done well in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin-- 
UMBRIDGE Excuse me, Minerva, but have you seen my note on Potter»s current grades in my class? 
MCGONAGALL Yes, indeed I have. 
UMBRIDGE Then I think you will find that Potter»s grades have been consistently poor this year. 
MCGONAGALL You apparently misunderstand me. I meant that Potter has done well in every Defense Against the Dark Arts class taught by a competent teacher. 
She turns briskly back to Harry. Umbridge looks as though she cannot believe her ears, then flips a page on her notepad and scribbles furiously. 
133. 
MCGONAGALL Now, assuming you»ve passed all of your necessary classes, the Ministry will put you through a number of character and aptitude tests. 
HARRY What»s involved in them? 
MCGONAGALL How you stand up under pressure, your perseverance, and dedication, things of this nature. 
Umbridge stands abruptly. 
UMBRIDGE Harry Potter has no chance of ever becoming an Auror! 
McGonagall stands as well, her eyes locked with Harry»s. 
MCGONAGALL I will assist you in becoming an Auror if it the very last thing I do, Potter! I will coach you nightly in order to get the necessary grades! 
Umbridege storms from the room. 
MCGONAGALL This concludes our meeting, Potter. 
She smiles at him. He smiles back. 
HARRY Thanks, Professor. 
MCGONAGALL You»re welcome, Potter. Now hurry or you»ll be late for Occlumency. 
INT. SNAPE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Harry sits down in front of Snape»s desk. 
SNAPE Have you been practicing, Potter? 
134. 
HARRY Yeah. 
SNAPE Well, we shall see, won»t we? 
He places his wand-tip to his head and extracts that same memory and places it in the pensive. 
Just then, the door opens and Draco Malfoy steps in. 
MALFOY Excuse me, Professor. Professor Umbridge says she needs you right away. 
SNAPE What on earth for? 
DRACO Well, sir, remember when Montegue vanished over Christmas? She says he»s turned up in a toilet on the fourth floor. 
SNAPE Any idea how he got there? 
DRACO He»s pretty confused, but I think he said something about the Vanishing Closet. 
Snape stands irritably. 
SNAPE We will pick your remedial potions lesson up tomorrow, Potter. 
Draco sniggers. They depart. 
Harry looks around for a moment, then stands and looks into the pensive. 
He looks at the door. There is silence. He plunges his head into the pensive, and his body is sucked into it. 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY 
Harry stands next to the GREAT LAKE. Under a tree sits a young Sirius. Next to him are the equally young Lupin, PETER PETIGREW, and lastly JAMES POTTER. 
135. 
James is playing with a Snitch, letting it go and catching it again. 
SIRIUS Put that away, James. 
James shrugs and does so. 
SIRIUS I»m bored. Wish it was full moon. 
Lupin snorts. 
LUPIN Easy for you to say. 
James nudges Sirius. 
JAMES This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. 
Sirius grins. 
SIRIUS Excellent! Snivellus! 
Snape is walking by. The four of them stand and follow him. 
JAMES All right, there, Snivellus? 
Snape turns in a flash, wand out. Sirius is faster, however. 
SIRIUS Expelliarmus! 
Snape»s wand flies from his hand. He dives for it. 
JAMES Impedimenta! 
Snape stops moving, struggling against INVISIBLE ROPES. 
SNAPE You just wait... 
Sirius laughs. 
SIRIUS Wait for what, Snivellus? You to wipe that great greasy nose on us? 
136. 
Several bystanders laugh. 
James raises his wand, turning to the bystanders. 
JAMES And now, the moment you»ve all been waiting for-- 
LILY EVENS Leave him alone, James Potter! 
James turns. Harry does as well. It is LILY EVANS. Harry»s mother. 
JAMES Another charity case, Lily? 
LILY EVENS What has he done to you? 
JAMES Nothing. It»s more the fact that he exists, you see... 
The IMPEDIMENT CURSE wears off. Snape grabs his wand and turns. James whirls. 
SNAPE Semper-- 
JAMES Levicorpus! 
Snape was lifted into the air and dangled by an ankle. He struggled madly, his robe hanging from his arms and over his head. 
LILY EVENS Leave him alone, Potter! 
James turns and smiles at her. 
JAMES I will if you go out with me. 
LILY EVENS I wouldn»t go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down. 
James shrugs and gestures with his wand. Snape falls to the ground. He tries to go for his wand again, but Sirius hexes him. 
137. 
SIRIUS Locomotor mortis! 
Lily draws her wand. 
LILY EVENS I said, leave him alone! 
James slowly turns to regard her. The playful expression on his face has vanished.JAMES Don»t make me hex you, Lily. 
LILY EVENS Then let him go! 
JAMES Fine! 
He mutters the counter-curse and Snape struggles to his feet again. 
JAMES You»re lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!SNAPE I don»t need help from a mud-blood like her! 
James eyes are BLAZING with anger. He points his wand, which is shaking in his hand from his rage, at Snape. 
JAMES Apologize to her! Now! 
LILY EVENS Don»t make him apologize. Honestly, you»re as bad as he is! 
James whirls on her. 
JAMES I would never call you that. 
She shakes her head. 
LILY EVENS You make me sick, Potter. 
She turns and walks away. 
138. 
JAMES Lily! Hey Lily! 
Harry watches her go. The adult Snape grabs Harry»s arm roughly. Harry turns to him, horrified. Snape yanks on the arm and the memory dissolves around them. 
INT. SNAPE»S OFFICE - DAY 
There is a BLAST of LIGHT, and Snape and Harry return to Snape»s office. 
Snape is livid with rage. He is pale, his lips thin. He is shaking. 
He pulls Harry close with trembling fingers, glaring daggers at him. 
SNAPE Having fun, Potter? 
Harry shakes his head, but Snape shakes him roughly, fury etched in his every feature. 
SNAPE Been enjoying yourself? 
HARRY No! 
SNAPE Amusing man, your father... 
His lips are shaking, his teeth bared. He shakes Harry again, absolutely SEETHING. 
HARRY I--sorry! 
Snape picks Harry up off the floor and FLINGS him away from him. Harry slams into a potions cabinet and falls to the ground as glass beakers and bottles shatter around him. 
Snape points a shaking finger at Harry. 
SNAPE You will repeat what you saw to no one! 
Harry is already shaking his head. 
139. 
HARRY No, of course not! 
Snape picks up a jar of some fluid and hurtles it across his office. It shatters into the wall. 
Snape grabs Harry by the robe and hauls him to his feet, shoving him against the wall. 
SNAPE You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born! 
He pushes Harry away from him. 
SNAPE Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again! 
Harry turns and runs. 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
The whole school is gathered in the great hall. 
Professor McGonagall stands in front of the staff table. 
MCGONAGALL Today begins your O.W.L exams. A number of Ministry instructors are here to give them. Exams will take place for the next two weeks. Exams will be split in two parts, theory and practical application. (pause) I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating spells have been added to your exam papers. No student has successfully cheated on an O.W.L. in a century, though every year someone tries it. (pause) Naturally, cheating will not be suffered and anyone caught will be expelled from Hogwarts.

EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT 
Harry and Ron stand on top of the ASTRONOMY tower, peering through telescopes into the night sky. 
Harry»s TELESCOPE is propped on the PARAPET and he is leaning over it slightly. 
Below him, the doors to the GREAT HALL groan open. GOLDEN LIGHT spills into the night, and six shadows move forward into the darkness. 
Harry and Ron watch. 
RON Oy! That»s Umbridge down there! 
Several other students begin to watch the proceedings taking place below. 
Harry looks panicked.HARRY They»re heading for Hagrid»s! 
Ron and Harry exchange nervous glances. 
PROFESSOR TOFTY Eyes back on the sky, please. 
The students ignore the Professor. 
The six shadows approach the hut, silhouetted against the windows of it. 
They open the door, and it closes. 
PROFESSOR TOFTY Twenty minutes left on your exam, students. 
Shadows pace past the windows to Hagrid»s hut. Raised voices reach them. 
Then a sharp BANG is heard, along with a flash of BLINDING light from within the cabin. 
The door bursts open and Hagrid stumbles out, clutching at his waist, followed by the other six. 
The six shadows fire STUN SPELLS at Hagrid. 
141. 
HARRY No! 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
The RED-COLORED spells simply impact with Hagrid and bounce off of him. 
HAWLISH Be reasonable, Hagrid! 
Hagrid yells uncomprehensibly. 
FANG leaps from the open door onto Hawlish, knocking the man over. Fang bounds over to Hagrid and leaps in front of him, taking a hex full in the chest and falls to the ground with a whine. 
Hagrid ROARS in rage, seizes the one responsible and hurls him ten feet through the air. The man lands hard and does not move. 
Professor McGonagall storms through the doors of the Great Hall and out into the night, fury written across her face. 
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT 
Ron points to McGonagall. 
RON Look! 
Harry smiles. 
RON McGonagall»ll sort this out! 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
She marches towards them. Her face is illuminated every few moments by the red light of spells being fired. 
MCGONAGALL (shouting in rage) How dare you! How DARE you! 
She breaks into a run.MCGONAGALL Stop this immediately! 
142. 
The firing continues.MCGONAGALL Enough! 
She draws her wand in a swift motion. Instantly, four of the attackers turn to her and fire their spells. 
Before she can even react, they slam into her. She is briefly illuminated in blood-red light and then is lifted from her feet and hurled backward five feet to slam into the ground. 
She does not move. 
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT 
Several students scream in terror. Professor Tofty covers her mouth. 
PROFESSOR TOFTY Not even a warning! 
Most of the students break for the doors leading back to the Entry Hall, Harry and Ron among them. Professor Tofty follows. 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Hagrid seems to go mad with anger. 
HAGRID COWARDS! 
He leaps at the nearest attacker and CRACKS him across the jaw. The man falls to the ground. Hagrid moves on to the next, and then the next. 
UMBRIDGE Get him, get him! 
But Hagrid, dodging more stunning spells, hoists Fang onto his shoulders and flees down towards the forest. 
EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Students and teachers spill from the entry hall out into the night, running for McGonagall. 
143. 
They surround her, several teachers leaning over her. She looks very pale and her eyes are closed. Others keep the students at a safe distance. 
PROFESSOR SPROUT Get her to the hospital wing right away. 
Professor Flitwick steps forward and levitates McGonagall into the air, floating her up the steps and into the school. They leave dozens of muttering students behind, in the night. 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
The long tables in the great hall have been moved aside. In their place, hundreds of desks have been set up. It is at one of these that Harry now sits. 
PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS stands near the staff table. 
PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS Before we begin, I have an update on Professor McGonagall. She will be all right, and is resting in the hospital wing. 
Harry and Ron look encouraged. 
PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS You may now turn your papers over and begin. 
Harry turns over his paper and stares at it. He begins to mark on it, scribbling answers. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
Harry stares at the last page of his exam. 
He winces and feels his scar. Shakes his head. Bends over his paper again. 
Again the scar twinges. Again he winces. 
The Great Hall FADES away. 
144. 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - DAY 
Harry moves down towards the door at the end of the corridor. The same white light glows around it»s edges as in his dreams... 
He pauses before it, then tries the handle. It opens. The LIGHT OVERWHELMS him. 
INT. HALL OF PROPHESY - DAY 
It dies abruptly. Harry stands in a huge room filled floor to ceiling with shelves. On each shelf there are many tiny GOLDEN ORBS. 
LORD VOLDEMORT stands, grinning coldly at a man lying on the floor. 
VOLDEMORT Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black? 
Sirius, surrounded by Death Eaters, glares defiantly at Voldemort. 
SIRIUS I would rather die! 
Voldemort raises his wand. Sirius SCREAMS in AGONY, WRITHING on the floor of the dark chamber. 
VOLDEMORT Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then. 
He releases Sirius, who slumps to the floor, panting for air. 
VOLDEMORT I»m going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! 
Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh. 
The room dissolves around Harry. 
145. 
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 
Harry falls out of his seat, clutching at his scar in agony. 
Professor Marchbanks hurries to Harry»s side. He pulls Harry to his feet and escorts him out of the Great Hall. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
Professor Marchbanks looks at Harry, concern on his face. 
PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS Are you all right, Potter? 
Harry shakes his head.PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you»ll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but-- 
Harry is shaking his head. 
HARRY No--no, I»ve done all I can. 
Professor Marchbanks nods, and returns to the Great Hall. He passes Ron and Hermione who run up to Harry. 
RON You all right? 
HARRY Voldemort! He»s got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries! 
Ron looks pale. 
HERMIONE How do you know? 
HARRY I just saw it. 
He looks out at the Hogwarts grounds, then turns back to them. 
HARRY How»re we going to get there? 
146. 
RON To the Department of Mysteries? 
HARRY We»ve got to do something! 
Ron and Hermione exchange looks. 
HERMIONE How»d Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world... 
RON Yeah. They can»t just waltz into the Ministry of Magic! 
HERMIONE It just seems so unlikely, Harry! 
Harry grabs her robes and glares at her. 
HARRY I won»t let Sirius die! 
Just then Ginny, Luna, Fred, and George round the corner. 
GINNY We heard Harry yelling. What»s up? 
HARRY Voldemort»s broken into the Department of Mysteries. He»s got Sirius there! (pause) He could already have the weapon! 
HERMIONE Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you»d rush off to save Sirius. 
HARRY There isn»t anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone! 
GINNY Anything we can do to help? 
HARRY No, there isn»t! 
147. 
Ginny crosses her arms, looking slightly hurt. 
HERMIONE Yes, they can, Harry. 
HARRY How? 
HERMIONE Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn»t at Headquarters. Which means we»ll need to break into Umbridge»s office. 
She smiles, and glances at Fred and George. 
HERMIONE For that, we»ll need a really good distraction. 
Fred and George grin.FRED Right you are, Hermione. Think we can whip something up, George? 
GEORGE Might be able to. 
FRED Just give us a few seconds. 
HERMIONE Mind you, it»s got to be really good! 
GEORGE Not to worry, Hermione. We»ve got something that will outdue everything else we»ve done here combined. 
FRED It»s been too quiet around here anyway. 
GEORGE Time we did some real damage to this place. 
They lean close to each other and begin whispering together in excited voices. 
148. 
HERMIONE We»ll also need to keep everyone away from her office. 
Ginny brightens. 
GINNY We can do that! Me and Luna»ll guard the hallway. 
Harry smiles at them.HERMIONE We»ll probably only manage five minutes or so. 
HARRY That»s all we»ll need. 
Fred and George straighten. 
FRED Right. You»ve got ten minutes to get to Umbridge»s office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours. 
GEORGE Unless they spread, in which case, I»d get out of the castle for a while. 
They leave. 
Hermione turns to Harry. 
HERMIONE Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry. 
INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY 
Ginny and Luna have taken up positions outside Umbridge»s office at the ends of the hall on either side. 
Suddenly, there is a BANG like a CANON has gone off, and the whole castle shakes. Dust drifts from the ceiling. 
Umbridge stumbles from her office, looking up at the ceiling. Filch tears around the corner. 
149. 
FILCH Professor! It»s those Weasley twins! They»ve set something off in the Astronomy Tower! 
Umbridge smiles twistedly. 
UMBRIDGE Ready to try out the old punishments again? 
FILCH (grinning) They»ve had this coming for a long time! 
They depart around the corner. A second later, the door to Umbridge»s office swings open and closed. 
INT. UMBRIDGE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Harry and Hermione drop the Invisibility cloak. Harry races to the fireplace, snatching up a handful of FLOO POWDER. He tosses it into the fire. 
HARRY Grimmauld Place! 
The fire turns bright green. Harry sticks his head into the fire. 
INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY 
Harry»s head appears in the kitchen. It is empty. 
HARRY Sirius! Are you here! 
INT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DAY 
Umbridge and Filch race around the corner and stop dead. There is a DRAGON made of FIREWORKS sweeping through the hallway. 
Umbridge draws her wand and tries to stop it. The spell EXPLODES harmless against the firework dragon, and it splits into a dozen dragons which fly down different corridors. 
They break into a run after the closest one and vanish down a hallway. 
150. 
Fred and George step out from behind a statue, laughing. 
FRED That was worth it! 
Filch steps back around the corner, grinning evilly. 
FILCH I»ve got you now! 
Fred and George break into a run. Filch follows, along with Umbridge. 
INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY 
Fred and George run full out down this hallway. Draco and the Inquisitional Squad comes around the corner ahead. Fred and George peel around, returning the way they had come, but Filch and Umbridge block that way off. 
The close in on the Weasley twins. Fred nods at George. George pulls a nasty-looking DEVICE from his pocket and drops it on the floor. 
It explodes in a flash of LIGHT. Everyone covers their eyes. When it clears, there is a huge SWAMP in the middle of the hall and the Weasleys are standing well beyond Umbridge and the Squad. 
FRED Thank you for playing, one and all. 
GEORGE And now, we»ve got to go! 
They turn and vanish down another hallway. 
INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY 
Harry continues to shout. 
HARRY Sirius! Lupin? Hello? 
KREACHER What»s this? The Potter boy in the fire... 
Kreacher comes into view of the fireplace. 
151. 
HARRY Kreacher, where»s Sirius? 
KREACHER Master went out. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
Fred and George skid to a stop in the entry hall near the great doors leading outside. 
From every direction, Inquisitional Squad members close in on them. 
Behind them, students and teachers pour into the entry hall. Beaming, and not appearing the least bit afraid, Fred and George wave to people in the crowd. 
UMBRIDGE So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it? 
FRED Fairly amusing, yeah. 
UMBRIDGE Well, now you»re going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school. 
Filch pulls out a long evil-looking BLACK WHIP, smiling. 
FRED This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore»s school! 
There is a loud cheer from the students filling the hall. 
Umbridge looks around, livid with rage. 
UMBRIDGE Well, now you»re going to get your punishments right here, in front of the whole school! 
Fred snorts. 
GEORGE You know, I don»t think we are. 
152. 
FRED George, I think we»ve outgrown full- time education. Wouldn»t you agree? 
GEORGE Completely, Fred. 
FRED Time to enter the real world? 
GEORGE Definitely. 
Together they raise their wands. 
FRED AND GEORGE Accio brooms! 
ITN. UMBRIDGE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Hermione shrieks as Fred and George»s brooms rip themselves from the wall and fly out the door. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
The brooms speed to Fred and George. They leap on them. 
Draco and some others from the Inquisitional Squad charge them. 
Fred and George kick off from the ground and into the air. Fred glares at Umbridge. 
FRED We won»t be seeing you. 
GEORGE Yeah, don»t bother writing. 
They wave their wands and the great doors open, revealing a BEAUTIFUL SUNSET over the Forbidden Forest. 
FRED Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley! 
And they dive on their brooms, sailing out the doors and into the beautiful sunset. 
153. 
INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY 
Harry glares at Kreacher. 
HARRY You know where he is, don»t you? 
KREACHER Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes. 
HARRY But you know. 
Kreacher grins horribly. 
KREACHER Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries! 
Harry gapes. Kreacher cackles in his nasty way, and scampers from the room. 
HERMIONE (v.o.) Harry! 
A stubby hand appears in the fire over Harry»s head and grabs his hair, yanking him back. Both head and hand vanish from the fireplace. 
INT. UMBRIDGE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Umbridge throws Harry to the floor. 
UMBRIDGE You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy! 
Harry looks around the room. Malfoy leans against a windowsill. Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Ron, and Neville are under guard by the Inquisitional Squad, their wands piled on the floor. 
Umbridege draws her wand and waves it at Harry. 
UMBRIDGE Accio wand! 
Harry»s wand flips from his pocket to Umbridge»s hand. 
UMBRIDGE Who were you trying to contact? 
HARRY It»s none of your business. 
UMBRIDGE Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please? 
Draco leaves. Umbridge smiles sickeningly at Harry. 
UMBRIDGE Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you. 
Draco returns with Snape. 
SNAPE You wished to see me? 
UMBRIDGE I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.SNAPE Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none. 
He turns to leave. Harry looks at him desperately. 
HARRY He»s got Padfoot at the place it»s hidden! 
UMBRIDGE What? What does that mean? 
SNAPE Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. 
He sweeps from the office. 
Umbridge is enraged. 
UMBRIDGE We»ve played nicely, Potter. You leave me no choice! 
She draws her wand, moving menacingly at Harry. 
154. 
155. 
UMBRIDGE You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off! 
HARRY You sent the Dementors? 
UMBRIDGE Of course I did! Someone had to act! 
She points her wand at Harry»s chest. 
UMBRIDGE CRUCIO! 
Harry SCREAMS as the curse washes over him. He slumps to the ground, shaking wildly. 
HERMIONE No! Please, stop! 
Umbridge looks pleased and turns to Hermione. 
UMBRIDGE Well, well.HARRY Hermione, no! 
HERMIONE We have to tell her, Harry... 
HARRY I would rather die! 
UMBRIDGE Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to? 
HERMIONE We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him... 
UMBRIDGE Tell him? 
HERMIONE That it»s ready. The weapon. 
156. 
Umbridge»s eyes are shining with eagerness. She smiles at Hermione. 
UMBRIDGE You and Mr. Potter will take me to it. 
INT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY 
Umbridge, Harry, and Hermione move through the forest. 
UMBRIDGE Much further, is it? 
HERMIONE Oh, yes. It»s very well hidden. 
They wander around for a while in silence. An ARROW lands in the ground next to them. They stop, as about fifty Centaurs emerge once again from the underbrush. 
MAGORIAN What are you doing in our forest? 
UMBRIDGE Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic! 
The centaurs move closer. 
UMBRIDGE Stay back, you beasts! 
There are HOWLS of rage from the ranks of Centaurs. Many nock and draw their bows. 
UMBRIDGE You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed-- 
HERMIONE Don»t call them that! 
Magorian ROARS in anger. 
MAGORIAN You dare to insult us? 
Umbridge points her wand at him, though it is shaking in her hands. 
157. 
UMBRIDGE Come no closer! 
Magorian rears up on his hind-legs and beats his chest. 
UMBRIDGE Incarcerus! 
Ropes fly from her wand and wrap themselves around Magorian. The Centaurs charge Umbridge. 
Harry grabs Hermione and they leap behind a tree. They can still here Umbridge scream, as the centaurs surround her. 
UMBRIDGE Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods! 
There is BLAST like a GUNSHOT and Umbridge screams again. 
Harry and Hermione are grabbed by two Centaurs. 
CENTAUR What of these two? 
CENTAUR #2 They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences! 
Several trees to their left are torn from the ground and tossed aside like twigs. There stands Grawp. 
The centaurs stop dead in their tracks. Grawp ROARS. 
INT. UMBRIDGE»S OFFICE - DAY 
Draco paces in front of Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville, smiling. 
DRACO God, I can»t wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long. 
Ron glares at him. 
RON Shut up, Malfoy! 
158. 
Draco smiles and punches Ron in the gut. He doubles over. 
DRACO That»s for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods! 
Ron has fallen near the pile of wands on the floor. Draco ignores him and sneers at Ginny. 
DRACO You know, Weasley, it»s really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets. 
Ginny struggles against Crabbe, who is restraining her. 
Ron snatches up his wand. 
RON Stupify! 
Crabbe falls over. Ginny leaps at Draco, who is knocked to the ground. Luna calmly kicks her restrainer in the shins. Neville slips out of the strangle-hold he»d been in and snatches up his wand. 
Goyle waves his wand, but Neville is faster. 
NEVILLE Expelliarmus! 
THe wand flies away. Ginny rolls away from Draco, scooping up her wand. She waves it at him, and he»s blasted backward into the wall. He slumps to the floor. 
They exit the office. 
INT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY 
There is silence as they all stare at Grawp. 
GRAWP Haggar! 
There is another silence. Grawp sees Harry and Hermione. 
GRAWP Hermy! Where Haggar? 
The centaurs raise their bows to point at the giant. 
159. 
HERMIONE Grawp, help us! 
Grawp ROARS again and BEATS his CHEST. 
GRAWP Grawp save Hermy! 
He reaches out for them. The centaurs LOOSE their ARROWS. They pepper Grawp across the face and chest. He roars in AGONY and begins stomping on the ground, as if trying to squash the centaurs, who scatter. 
Harry grabs Hermione»s hand and drags her away from the fight. As they depart, they hear Grawp one last time. 
GRAWP (v.o.) GRAWP WANT HAGGAR! 
Harry and Hermione reach the edge of the forest. They stop to catch their breath. 
HARRY Great plan, Hermione. 
HERMIONE I thought it worked out rather nicely. 
HARRY What are we supposed to do now? 
RON That»s just what we were wondering. 
Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville appear from around Hagrid»s hut. 
Harry and Hermione look surprised. 
RON So, how do we get to the Ministry? 
He tosses Harry and Hermione their wands. 
HERMIONE I»d imagine we should fly. 
HARRY We»ve got no brooms. 
160. 
LUNA There are other ways to fly. 
She nods in the direction of the forest. 
LUNA I mean, they can fly, and they»re very good at finding places you need to go. 
Harry turns around and sees three THESTRALS watching them. 
HARRY What are those? 
RON What are what? 
He looks right at them and doesn»t see them. 
HERMIONE There»s nothing there, Harry. 
LUNA Yes, there is. They»re Thestrals. You can»t see them unless you»ve seen someone die. 
Neville is quiet. Finally, he looks up. 
NEVILLE I can see them too. 
Harry claps his hands.HARRY All right, then. Get on one, and we»ll be off. 
RON And what about those of us who can»t see them? 
Luna comes over to them. 
LUNA I»ll show you. 
INT. BRITAIN - NIGHT 
The sun has set behind the mountains in the distance. 
161. 
Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, and Luna and Neville are each paired on one Thestral as they fly over the BRITISH LANDSCAPE towarsd LONDON. 
The Thestrals dive. Hermione gives a SHRIEK of surprise as they swoop down closer to the lights of London. 
INT. LONDON - NIGHT 
They SOAR between buildings and finally set down in front of a TELEPHONE BOOTH. 
Ron jumps off of the thestral shakily. 
RON Never again... 
GINNY What now, Harry? 
Harry leads the way to the telephone booth. He opens the door and steps in. The rest cram inside with him. 
INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - NIGHT 
The lift grinds to a halt and the doors swing open. Harry and the others step out to the receptionist area with the GOLDEN FOUNTAIN. 
The place is deathly quiet and completely deserted. 
They fan out, wands at the ready. Harry waits a moment. 
HARRY All right, come on. 
They head past the fountain and up the steps into the Ministry of Magic. 
INT. LIFT - NIGHT 
This larger lift CLINKS downward slowly. Finally, it grinds to a halt. 
FEMALE VOICE Department of Mysteries. 
The doors open and Harry leads the others out. This department too is abandoned. 
162. 
HARRY Where is everyone? 
GINNY The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home. 
Harry nods grimly. 
HARRY That»s how Voldemort got in unnoticed. 
They walk until they reach the hallway from Harry»s dreams. 
HARRY This is it. Come on. 
They make their way down the long hall until they reach the door at the end of the hall. Only it does not glow. 
Harry tries the handle. It swings open. 
HARRY Stay close. 
He steps into the next room. 
INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT 
This room is large and circular. It is filled with identical doors all the way around. It is illuminated by BLUE-FLAMED CANDLES. 
After Neville enters the room, the door swings shut with an ECHOING BANG. 
GINNY Now where? 
Harry looks around, confused. 
HARRY I don»t understand. In my dream, the doors weren»t identical. 
HERMIONE Well, let»s try a few. 
Harry nods. 
163. 
HARRY Yeah. I»ll know the way when I see it. 
He goes to the first door he sees and opens the door. 
He steps inside. The others follow. 
INT. ROOM OF THE VEIL - NIGHT 
Harry opens the door and enters. The rest follow. 
The room is like an upside-down ZIGGURAT, with huge steps leading to the base of the pit. On the lowest level rests a dark, grey VEIL that flutters as if there were a breeze. 
Soft whispers fill the room. 
HARRY Who»s there? 
He clambers down to the Veil and stares hard at it. The whispers INTENSIFY. Harry looks around the room. 
HARRY Sirius? 
HERMIONE There»s no one here, Harry. This isn»t the right room. 
HARRY Does anyone else hear that? 
LUNA I do. It»s coming from the Veil. 
They look at it. It flutters menacingly though there is no wind. 
Harry moves closer to it, slowly. 
HERMIONE (quietly) Harry... 
His eyes are locked on the veil. He walks closer. 
LUNA There are people in there! 
164. 
RON What do you mean, people? 
HERMIONE Harry, I think we should leave. 
Harry reaches out his hand towards the veil. 
Hermione comes up behind Harry and grabs his arm. He tries to pull away from her, eyes still locked on the veil. 
The whispers have intensified into HARSH MOANS as Harry is only feet away from the veil. 
HERMIONE Harry, we»re here for Sirius, remember? 
Harry stops. He blinks and drops his hand. 
HARRY Sirius...yeah... 
She gently leads him away from the Veil. The moans have returned to whispers once again, muttering angrily as they depart. 
INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT 
They return to the Room of Doors. Hermione draws a FLAMING X over the door they just closed. 
Harry moves to the next one. It is locked. He raises his wand. 
HARRY Alohomora! 
It remains closed. 
HARRY Whatever»s in there, the Ministry sure doesn»t want anyone getting to it. 
He moves to the next door and opens it, stepping inside. 
INT. CLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 
They enter the CLOCK ROOM. Every surface is covered in clocks. 
165. 
HARRY This is it! Come on! 
They move through the clocks. 
Harry leads them back to the end of the room, where another door lies. 
HARRY This is it. This is where Sirius is! 
He opens the door and charges through. 
INT. HALL OF PROPHESY - NIGHT 
Harry and the others spill into the HALL OF PROPHESY and stop. Harry glances around. They grip their wands tightly. 
The room is GIGANTIC, being over fifty feet high and incredibly lond. There are rows and rows of shelves. 
On every shelf are dozens of dusty GOLDEN ORBS. 
The room is LIT by more BLUE-FLAMED CANDLES. 
HARRY He»s in here somewhere. 
He leads them down the center isle, peering down each row. He turns down one row, leading them to the end. This end opens out into another wide isle. 
The row is empty. He looks around in confusion. 
HERMIONE I don»t think Sirius is here. 
Ron stares at one of the orbs. 
RON Harry, have you seen this? 
Harry looks over his shoulder. 
RON Er...it»s got your name on it. 
Sure enough, there was a golden orb resting on the shelf with the label ≈S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.: The Dark Lord and (?) Harry Potter. 
166. 
Harry reaches out for it. 
HARRY What»s my name doing here? 
HERMIONE Don»t touch it, Harry! 
Harry glares at her. 
HARRY Why not? 
NEVILLE Yeah, Harry, don»t. 
He looks at Neville, who is very pale. 
HARRY It»s got my name on it! 
He takes it off the shelf and looks at it. 
LUCIUS I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter. 
LUCIUS MALFOY emerges from the shadows, cloaked all in black. Two dozen other Death Eaters emerge around him. 
Harry and the others are surrounded and outnumbered. 
HARRY Where»s Sirius? 
Lucius, and several other death eaters laugh. 
LUCIUS We don»t have him, if that»s what you mean. 
Harry is stunned. 
HARRY You never did, did you? It was all just a trick. 
LUCIUS The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here. 
167. 
Lucius reaches out his hand, palm up. 
LUCIUS Now give me that prophesy. 
HARRY What prophesy? 
Lucius points at the Golden orb. 
LUCIUS That prophesy. Now hand it over or we»ll have to use wands on you. 
Harry raises his wand at the same time that Ginny, Neville, Hermione, Ron, and Luna raised theirs. 
HARRY Go ahead. 
Lucius regards him coldly. 
LUCIUS Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?HARRY Come and find out! 
Lucius doesn»t move. 
LUCIUS Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won»t have to die here. 
One of the Death Eaters moves forward, throwing back her hood. It is BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. 
BELLATRIX I haven»t escaped from Azkaban for this! 
She raises her wand. Lucius forces her arm down. 
LUCIUS No! If the prophesy is smashed-- 
He stops and turns back to Harry. But Bellatrix turns to several other Death Eaters. 
168. 
BELLATRIX Take the youngest girl. We»ll see how committed Potter is as we torture her. 
Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville close in around Ginny. Harry steps in front of Ginny, wand out and aimed at Bellatrix»s chest. He holds the prophesy in his other hand. 
HARRY You even try to take her and I»ll smash this thing. 
He tosses the prophesy casually into the air and catches it again. Lucius starts in horror. 
HARRY So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here? 
BELLATRIX Surely you jest, Potter? 
HARRY Not really. How come Voldemort wants it? 
LUCIUS You dare to speak the Dark Lord»s name? 
HARRY Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, voldemort, Voldemort-- 
BELLATRIX Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half-blood mouth! 
HARRY Hey, did you know Voldemort»s a half-blood too? 
Bella raises her wand to strike, but Malfoy stops her again. 
LUCIUS Control yourself, Bellatrix! 
HARRY What»s so special about this prophesy anyway? 
Bella shrieks with laughter. 
169. 
LUCIUS You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here? 
Harry looks as if slapped, he is so surprised. 
HARRY What? 
Lucius and the Death Eaters laugh. 
HARRY (whispering) When I give the signal, blast the shelves... 
Hermione and Ron nod grimly. 
LUCIUS So that»s what took you so long. We wondered. 
HARRY But why did he need me to take it? 
LUCIUS Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn»t get it himself. 
Harry is angry. 
HARRY So he used me to do his dirty work, did he? 
LUCIUS Precisely, Potter. 
HARRY NOW! 
No less than six wands fire into the shelves at once. The Death Eaters cover their faces as DEBRIS covers them. 
HARRY RUN! 
Dust fills the air. Entire shelves fall CRASHING to the ground, raining glass shards and golden orbs. The students break and run for the door. 
170. 
Malfoy grabs Harry by the shoulder. Hermione waves her wand at him. 
HERMIONE Stupify! 
Malfoy is blasted backward. Harry and Hermione run after the others. 
Spells explode around them. 
LUCIUS Stop them! 
Harry is the last through the door. 
INT. CLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 
Hermione slams the door shut and points her wand at it. 
HERMIONE Colloportus! 
The door seals itself. 
Harry looks around. Only Hermione and Neville are still with him. 
HARRY Where»d the rest go? 
Hermione looks around.HERMIONE Harry, they went the wrong way! 
They run after Ron, Ginny, and Luna. Just then, the door blasts off its hinges. 
Harry, Hermione, and Neville dive underneath several desks. 
Death Eaters enter the room, slowly moving between the clocks and desks. 
DEATH EATER They might have gone on to the hall. 
BELLATRIX Check under the desks. 
Harry leaps out from under his desk. 
171. 
HARRY Stupify! 
A JET of RED LIGHT hits one of the Death Eaters in the chest. He is knocked backward into the wall. 
Hermione jumps from under her desk and runs for the exit. Bellatrix sees her and raises her wand. 
BELLATRIX Avada-- 
Neville emerges from beneath his desk. 
NEVILLE Expelliarmus! 
Bella»s wand flies from her fingers. Harry finishes her off. 
HARRY Stupify! 
Bellatrix is STRUCK with the same red light and falls to the ground. 
There is a YELL from the next room. 
HARRY Ron! 
Two Death Eaters enter the room. 
DEATH EATER Impedimenta! 
The spell blasts Harry, Hermione, and Neville backward. Neville flies over a desk. Hermione strikes a bookshelf and is nearly buried under the falling books, and Harry strikes the wall. 
DEATH EATER We»ve got him! 
HERMIONE Silenco! Stupify! 
The death eater falls silent, and then to the ground. 
Harry staggers to his feet, dazed. 
HARRY Pretificus Totalus! 
172. 
The second Death Eater falls to the ground and cannot move. The mute Death Eater attacks Hermione, making a slashing movement with his wand. 
Purple flame BLASTS from the wand and slashes Hermione across the chest. Her eyes go wide and she falls to the ground. 
NEVILLE Stupify! 
The death eater falls over. 
HARRY Hermione! 
He runs to her. She appears to be sleeping. 
HARRY Please don»t be dead, please don»t be dead... 
He shakes her. 
HARRY Hermione, wake up... 
Neville runs over. 
NEVILLE What»s they do to her? 
Harry shakes his head. Neville feels her wrist. 
NEVILLE She»s alive, Harry. There»s a pulse. 
Harry sighs in relief.HARRY Can we carry her? 
NEVILLE I»ll do it. You»re better at fighting. 
He hoists Hermione up on his back. They move on to the next room. 
173. 
INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT 
Harry, and Neville, still carrying Hermione, re-emerge into the circular room of doors. Hermione»s X»s have fades from the walls. 
NEVILLE Where do we go? 
HARRY I don»t know... 
A door opens and Luna and Ginny emerge, helping Ron walk between them. 
HARRY What happened. 
GINNY I think my ankle»s broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell... 
Ron laughs strangely.RON Hiyya, Harry. (he giggles) You look funny.... 
He laughs again. 
Ginny»s legs give way, and both she and Ron fall to the ground. 
Harry is at Ginny»s side, looking concerned. She is breathing very hard. 
LUNA They hit her with something too. 
Harry straightens. 
HARRY We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny? 
Luna moves to her side. 
Another door opens, and five death eaters emerge. 
174. 
BELLATRIX There they are! 
Stunning spells rain all around them. The wounded group heads for the nearest door. 
Luna is blasted off her feet by a stunning spell. She and Ginny TUMBLE to the floor. Harry has no choice but to keep running. 
The next stunning spell hits Neville in the back. He falls to the ground, Hermione rolling away from him. 
INT. ROOM OF THE VEIL - NIGHT 
Harry and Ron stagger into the Room of the Veil. Just as they enter, Ron is hit and falls. Harry slips and tumbles down to the bottom of the chamber. He comes to rest by the DAIS of the Veil. 
Doors all around him burst open and Death Eaters enter, climbing down to surround him--from a safe distance. 
Harry staggers up onto the dais, his wand held weakly in his hand. Blood trickles out of his mouth and down his chin. 
Malfoy shoves his way towards Harry. 
LUCIUS Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over. 
Harry glances around frantically. 
HARRY Let my friends go and I will. 
Bellatrix and several other Death Eaters drag his friends into the chamber. 
LUCIUS You are not in a position to negotiate. 
Neville struggles against the Death Eater holding him. 
NEVILLE Don»t do it, Harry! Don»t! 
HARRY Stop, Neville! 
175. 
Bellatrix looks at Neville. 
BELLATRIX Neville? Neville Longbottom? 
She laughs in glee. 
BELLATRIX My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time! 
NEVILLE You put them in St. Mungos! 
Bellatrix beams at him. 
BELLATRIX So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I»ll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents. 
Harry is desperate. 
NEVILLE Don»t give it to them! 
Bellatrix points her wand at him. 
BELLATRIX Crucio! 
Neville HOWLS in PAIN, curling up in a ball and SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. 
The doors at the top of the chamber EXPLODE off their hinges. Everything stops as Lupin, Sirius, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. 
They BLAST spells at the Death Eaters. Malfoy moves to attack, but Tonks disarms him. 
Harry leaps off of the DAIS, landing next to Neville. 
HARRY Are you all right? 
NEVILLE Yeah... 
He and Harry begin making their way away from the fighting. A man grabs Harry from behind, his large, sweaty arm around Harry»s throat. 
176. 
DEATH EATER Give me the prophesy! 
Neville leaps upon his back and hits him in the face. Harry elbows him in the ribs. The man falls away. As he falls, he strikes Harry»s hand by accident. 
The prophesy flies from his hand. 
Malfoy sees it. He raises his wand. Sirius leaps into him. Both men fall the rest of the way to the lowest level of the room, landing hard. 
The prophesy bounces off of a step, flips down to the next level and shatters against the stone. 
A GHOSTLY version of Professor Trelawney appears over the shattered golden orb, speaks something which cannot be heard over the fight, and dissolves away. 
Harry and Neville seem frozen, staring at the broken pieces of the orb. 
Sirius gets to his feet and sprints to Harry and Neville. 
SIRIUS Get out of here, you two! 
He points at one of the doors. 
SIRIUS That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries. 
Sirius makes to go back to the fight. Harry grabs his hand. 
HARRY You come with us! 
Sirius shakes his head. 
SIRIUS You»re the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order. 
Slowly, Harry lets go of Sirius»s robe sleeve. He looks into his Godfather»s eyes.SIRIUS I»ll always be here for you, Harry. Now go! 
177. 
He pushes Harry away from him towards the door. A spell rockets past Sirius»s head. 
Bellatrix leaps down in front of Sirius. She smiles. Sirius grins. 
SIRIUS Hello, cousin! 
He fires a spell at her. She dodges, leaping down to the Dais on which the Veil sits. Sirius leaps after. Their wands clash, blinding lights exploding from the tips. 
Harry and Neville climb towards the door. 
LUCIUS Potter! 
They whirl around to find Lucius only feet away, holding his wand out at them. 
LUCIUS We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord! 
He waves his wand. 
LUCIUS Stupify! 
Harry raises his own.HARRY Protego! 
Malfoy»s spell bounces away from Harry. 
The door opens and Dumbledore, EYES BLAZING, enters, his wand at the ready. 
NEVILLE It»s Dumbledore! 
Malfoy attempts to run, but Dumbledore snaps his wand out, and Malfoy is knocked over and dragged back. 
Dumbledore moves past Harry and Neville, descending into what appears to be a war zone. 
He reaches the fight before the Death Eaters even know he»s there. 
178. 
Dumbledore blasts two of them across the room before the rest notice. They break for the exits, but members of the Order are already there, stunning them. 
Bellatrix fires a stunning spell. Sirius ducks under it, laughing. 
SIRIUS Is that the best you»ve got, cousin? 
He doesn»t even see it coming. He»s barely finished his sentence when the second spell strikes him in the chest. 
He is lifted up into the air, a look of shock upon his face. 
Time seems to slow for Harry as he watches Sirius»s descent. 
And then Sirius falls into the Veil, his body simply falling behind it. He does not reappear on the other side. 
Harry sprints for his Godfather, but he seems to move in slow motion. 
HARRY (screaming) Sirius! 
He leaps down towards the Veil, abandoning everything. Tears are streaming down his face. His wand drifts from his grasp and clatters behind him. 
He leaps to the lowest level and charges up to the DAIS. Lupin reaches out and grabs him, holding him fast. 
HARRY (screaming) Let me go! 
He hits at Lupin, trying to break away from him. 
LUPIN Harry! HARRY!...he»s gone...there»s nothing you can do... 
Harry hits him across the face, still struggling wildly. 
HARRY LIAR! 
Things seem to slow down. All sound dies away for Harry. Spells flash and explode all around, bathing the room in strange colors, mixing with the light of the blue candles. 
179. 
But Harry»s legs simply give out and he slumps against Lupin, who is also weeping. 
Harry clenches and unclenches his fists in agony, beating them weakly against Lupin»s chest. 
HARRY No...no...no.... 
Lupin bodily picks Harry up, still weeping, and carries him away from the Dais. 
He lets go of Harry and turns to help Neville. Harry stands, dumbfounded beside him, still staring at the Veil. 
Kingsley leaps up to duel with Bellatrix, but she blasts him aside. 
Dumbledore turns and attempts to stop her, but she deflects the spell and leaps towards the door. 
Harry watches her, and there is COLD FURY in his eyes. 
Harry sprints after her. Lupin turns to see him leaping up after Bellatrix. 
LUPIN Harry, no! 
He flies through the door after her. 
INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT 
Harry enters just to see Bellatrix escape through a doorway. He charges after her. 
EXT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - NIGHT 
Harry sprints down the steps leading out to the GOLDEN FOUNTAIN and the Telephone Lift. Bellatrix is nearly to it. 
BELLATRIX You can»t stop me, Potter! 
HARRY I»LL KILL YOU!! 
He brandishes his wand. 
HARRY Stupify! 
180. 
Bellatrix turns and deflects it. She fires back at him. Harry dives behind the fountain. 
There is silence. Then, the slow footfalls of Bellatrix. 
BELLATRIX Come out, come out, Potter... 
Harry grows more angry by the second. 
BELLATRIX Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather? 
Harry leaps out from behind the fountain. 
HARRY Crucio! 
He hits her squarely in the chest. She SHRIEKS in pain and falls to the ground, but she rolls away from him to her feet almost immediately. 
BELLATRIX Crucio! 
Harry leaps behind the statue of the Centaur. Bellatrix»s spell blasts the Centaur»s head off. It clangs away into the darkness. 
BELLATRIX Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul... 
She tries to outflank him, but he moves behind another statue. 
BELLATRIX Give me the prophesy! 
HARRY Can»t. It got smashed by accident! 
BELLATRIX You lie! 
Harry laughs. 
181. 
HARRY How»s Voldemort going to like that? You»ve failed him, and he»s not very forgiving, is he? 
Bellatrix lets out a shriek of horror. 
BELLATRIX Forgive me, Master! I tried, I-- 
Harry laughs again. 
HARRY He can»t hear you from here, you know! 
VOLDEMORT Can»t I, Potter? 
Voldemort has appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointed at Harry. 
VOLDEMORT So, you smashed my prophesy... 
Harry doesn»t move, frozen into stillness by the horror. Voldemort sneers. 
VOLDEMORT I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! 
He snaps his wand down. 
VOLDEMORT Avada Kadavra! 
Green light EXPLODES from his wand. Harry flinches, but the statue of the GOLDEN WIZARD leaps down from the fountain and takes the blast full in the chest. It explodes in a thousand shards of molten metal. 
Voldemort whirls. Dumbledore stands at the doorway, looking ferocious, his BLUE EYES BLAZING. 
DUMBLEDORE You should not have come here tonight, Tom. 
VOLDEMORT It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore! 
182. 
He slashes with his wand. 
VOLDEMORT Avada Kedavra! 
Dumbledore VANISHES with a swirl of his cloak and reappears between Voldemort and Bellatrix. 
She tries to run, but Dumbledore knocks her to the ground with a stunning spell, vanishing again just as another KILLING CURSE strikes the wall and explodes, shaking the hall. 
He reappears close to Voldemort. Dumbledore raises his wand and strikes. 
A BLINDING LIGHT issues forth from it, the POWER of it staggering. Voldemort conjures a GLOWING, TRANSLUCENT SHIELD around himself. Dumbledore»s spell COLLIDES with it, filling the room completely with BLINDING LIGHT. The whole room shakes. 
Harry staggers to the ground. Bits of dust and rock fall from the walls. 
The light fades and Voldemort is unharmed. 
VOLDEMORT You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?DUMBLEDORE There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom. 
VOLDEMORT There is nothing worse than death! 
DUMBLEDORE You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been. 
Voldemort fires another killing curse at Dumbledore. Fawkes the Phoeniz swoops down from above and SWALLOWS the jet of green light, EXPLODING into flames and falling to the earth. 
Dumbledore spins, sending a constant flow of BLINDING LIGHT BLASTING from his wand, the sheer POWER of it SHAKING the HALL. Voldemort raises his own wand, and the LIGHT separates around him. Dumbledore and Voldemort are SURROUNDED by the flow of LIGHT. 
183. 
Dumbledore grits his teeth as a high wind BILLOWS his CLOAK around him. Voldemort glares at Dumbledore, EYES BLOOD-RED. His wand trembles in his hand, and Voldemort is slowly being forced backward by the power of the STREAM of LIGHT. 
Fear flickers in Voldemort»s eyes. He lets out a ROAR of frustration. A ring of GREEN FLAME surrounds him, and he vanishes in a TONGUE of RED-ORANGE FIRE. 
Dumbledore»s stream of LIGHT BLASTS into the wall and PUNCHES a HUGE, GAPING HOLE in the wall, shaking the whole Ministry. 
Harry is lifted bodily into the air and tossed into the wall from the explosion. 
There is a sharp CRACK of rock BREAKING, and half of the ceiling falls in. Dumbledore whips around his wand and Harry is pulled from under the falling rocks. 
Voldemort reappears on the PILINTH where the statues had been. 
HARRY Look out! 
He raised his wand, shouting a spell. The water in the pool below the statues instantly flow upward to surround Voldemort in a globe of water. 
Voldemort vanishes from within the globe of water, and it crashes back down to the pool, spilling over onto the floor. 
HARRY Professor! 
He stands up. 
DUMBLEDORE Stay where you are, Harry! 
Dumbledore sounds frightened. 
Then Harry SCREAMS. His scar simply SPLITS open and BLOOD SPIRTS from it. He shrieks in agony, the pain unbearable. 
Harry speaks, but it is not his voice. 
HARRY/VOLDEMORT Kill me now, Dumbledore...do it, if death means nothing... 
184. 
Green flames explode from all of the fireplaces around them, and people appear as they APPERATE. Cornelius Fudge arrives too. 
Voldemort shrieks in pain, and he appears across the room. He snatches up the unconscious body of Bellatrix and DISSAPARATES in a blast of GREEN FIRE. 
Harry slumps to the ground. His eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Blood flows from his scar across his face to the ground. 
DUMBLEDORE Harry! 
He runs to Harry»s side and touches his skin. He closes his eyes and whispers a spell. Harry»s eyes snap open. 
DUMBLEDORE Are you all right, Harry? 
Harry nods, dazed. 
PERCY Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there! 
Fudge is standing in the middle of the room, a dazed look also on his face. 
FUDGE I know...I saw him too... 
Dumbledore stands. Half the room gasps and draws back. Fudge seems to notice him for the first time. 
DUMBLEDORE If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended. 
Fudge points at Dumbledore. 
FUDGE Seize him! 
Dumbledore stands to his full height, his eyes BLAZING with ANGER. 
185. 
DUMBLEDORE Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses! 
Fudge looks cowed. 
DUMBLEDORE If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be. 
No one looks remotely interested in trying to arrest Dumbledore. 
FUDGE Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here? 
Dumbledore smiles, and walks back over to Harry, lifting him to his feet. 
DUMBLEDORE I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school. 
Fudge (and half the crowd) turns to see Harry for the first time. 
FUDGE What»s he doing here? And what»s happened to him? 
Dumbledore taps his wand against Harry»s scar and the bleeding stops. 
He turns to the Minister of Magic. 
DUMBLEDORE Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school. (pause) Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. (pause) 
(MORE) 
186. 
DUMBLEDORE (cont'd) 
All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work. 
Fudge is sputtering incomprehensibly. 
DUMBLEDORE I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. 
He taps the Golden centaur head. 
DUMBLEDORE Portus. 
He motions Harry over. FUDGE Dumbledore, I want some answers! 
DUMBLEDORE The Second War has begun, Minister. 
Harry takes the head with Dumbledore, and they vanish from the Ministry of Magic. 
INT. DUMBLEDORE»S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Harry and Dumbledore reappear in his office. There are shouts of welcome from the portraits. 
DUMBLEDORE Thank you... 
He takes a small baby Phoenix from his pocket and places it on Fawkes» stand. 
Dumbledore»s desk has been repaired, and the Pensive rests upon it. 
DUMBLEDORE Please sit, Harry. 
Harry is staring at him, bitterness and sorrow evident on his face. 
DUMBLEDORE I understand how you feel, Harry-- 
HARRY No you don»t! 
187. 
Dumbledore looks hard at him. 
DUMBLEDORE You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. 
Harry nearly snarls at him. 
DUMBLEDORE There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength...HARRY You don»t have a clue! You can»t possibly know! 
DUMBLEDORE What can»t I know? 
Harry grabs an instrument from one of the tables and throws it across the room. 
DUMBLEDORE This pain is part of being human, Harry... 
HARRY (screaming) Then I don»t want to be human! 
He kicks at a table, and the leg breaks, sending the whole thing crashing to the ground. 
HARRY I don»t care! I don»t care! 
He begins to silently weep, tears pouring down his face. He throws over another table and falls to his knees. 
DUMBLEDORE You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it. 
Harry gets to his feet. 
Harry turns and moves to the door. He yanks on the handle. The door will not open. He looks at Dumbledore. 
188. 
HARRY Let me out.DUMBLEDORE No. 
Harry draws his wand, looking furious. 
HARRY You can»t keep me in here! 
DUMBLEDORE I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I»m afraid to say you will regret it. 
Harry is silent, breathing hard and glaring at Dumbledore. The Headmaster indicates the chair in front of his desk. 
Harry finally sits, looking sulky. 
DUMBLEDORE It is my fault Sirius died tonight. (pause) I have kept things from you, Harry. Things that I should not have concealed. You had a right to know, but I put off telling you. 
Dumbledore sighs, sadly, and suddenly he seems very old. 
DUMBLEDORE Had I told you that Voldemort might try to lure you down to the Department of Mysteries you would never have gone there tonight. Sirius would never have gone after you.(pause) That fault lies with me. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me one day. 
Harry stares angrily out the window. 
DUMBLEDORE Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man. 
Harry continues staring out the window. 
DUMBLEDORE Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connection goes both ways. (pause) I grew worried that Voldemort would at some point discover this connection, which he did the night Mr. Weasely was attacked. 
HARRY I already know all this. 
DUMBLEDORE Haven»t you wondered why I haven»t spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?HARRY Well, yeah, I did... 
DUMBLEDORE I was worried that if Voldemort discovered there was a closer relationship between us than simply between teacher and student he would use you to spy on the Order. Another mistake. (pause) Voldemort showed us both tonight that his aim in possessing you would not be to destroy me, but to destroy you. 
Harry looks at his shoes. 
DUMBLEDORE Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency. 
HARRY But Snape stopped giving me lessons. 
189. 
190. 
DUMBLEDORE Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed. 
HARRY He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-- 
DUMBLEDORE I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year. 
HARRY Sirius didn»t trust him. Didn»t believe he»d really turned to our side... 
DUMBLEDORE Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. 
Harry glares at the carpet. 
DUMBLEDORE During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries. 
HARRY I»ve been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection. 
DUMBLEDORE Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams. (pause) 
(MORE) 
191. 
DUMBLEDORE (cont'd) Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius. 
HARRY But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said-- 
DUMBLEDORE Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries. 
HARRY Why? 
DUMBLEDORE Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now. 
HARRY What? 
DUMBLEDORE It appears that when Sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he meant out of the house. So he went to the Black»s closest relatives, the Malfoys. (pause) Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with you. (pause) He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius. (pause) Voldemort knew that making you believe he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries would force you there.HARRY Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him? 
DUMBLEDORE Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to (MORE) contact Headquarters. 
192. 
DUMBLEDORE (cont'd) Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called. 
HARRY And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!DUMBLEDORE She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated. 
HARRY Sirius hated him. 
DUMBLEDORE He didn»t hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated. 
HARRY Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there! 
DUMBLEDORE I was trying to save his life! 
Dumbledore buries his head in his hands. Harry is dumbfounded. 
The Headmaster looks up finally. 
DUMBLEDORE It is time to tell you what I should have five years ago. No doubt you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family? (pause) I did it for your protection. You were in more danger than anyone realized. Voldemort was defeated, but his servants were everywhere. 
Harry is silent. 
DUMBLEDORE I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated. (pause) 
(MORE) 
This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia. 
HARRY She never loved me. 
DUMBLEDORE Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt»s house your home, you are protected. 
Harry looks away. 
DUMBLEDORE And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders. 
Harry stares into his blue eyes. 
DUMBLEDORE Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort? 
Harry nods. 
DUMBLEDORE Do you remember what you asked me that night?HARRY I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me. 
DUMBLEDORE Yes. I decided not to tell you then. After all, eleven was too young for such burdens. The same went for twelve. But I was running out of excuses by thirteen and fourteen. Do you see the flaw in my plan yet? 
Harry shakes his head. 
193. 
DUMBLEDORE (cont'd) 
194. 
DUMBLEDORE I cared about you too much. I became more concerned with your happiness and well-being than with the truth and the lives it could save. That was my greatest mistake. It was exactly what Voldemort expects from us fools who love. (pause) But I could not bear to tell you. I have watched you pass through greater trials than any other student in the history of this school, and I could not bear to add another one, the greatest one of all. 
He looks at Harry, sympathy and regret etched on his face. 
DUMBLEDORE You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must. 
HARRY I don»t understand, Professor. 
Dumbledore sighs again. 
DUMBLEDORE The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the terms of the prophesy. Voldemort»s mistake was that he had not heard the entire prophesy. (pause) That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you. 
Harry sighs this time. He looks at the floor. 
HARRY Professor, why am I so important to him? 
Harry hangs his head. 
195. 
DUMBLEDORE An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy. 
HARRY Sir, it got smashed. 
DUMBLEDORE That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved. 
Dumbledore raises his wand to his temple and extracts a memory, placing it in the pensive. He waves his wand over it. 
The ghostly image of Professor Trelawney rises from the bowl. 
TRELAWNEY ≈The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to those who have thrise defied him, born as the Seventh Month dies...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives....The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the Seventh Month dies... 
The image of Trelawney fades. 
Harry looks staggered.HARRY I»m not sure I understand all that, sir... 
DUMBLEDORE It means that the only person with a chance of defeating Voldemort was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before. 
HARRY And...it means me? 
DUMBLEDORE Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom.HARRY So it»s not necessarily me, sir? 
DUMBLEDORE You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will mark this boy as his equal. (pause) In giving you that scar, Voldemort did so. I»m afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you. 
HARRY What if he chose wrong? 
DUMBLEDORE He chose the child he believed to be the more dangerous. He chose the ≈half-blood wizard because he saw some of himself in you. (pause) He tried to kill you and instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him. 
HARRY Why didn»t he wait? Why attack when we were babies? 
DUMBLEDORE Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn»t know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power. 
HARRY But I don»t have any special powers. 
Dumbledore is silent for a moment. 
196. 
197. 
DUMBLEDORE There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none. 
HARRY What is it, sir? 
DUMBLEDORE This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it. (pause) In the end, it was your heart and not your head that saved you. 
Harry looks away. 
DUMBLEDORE There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven»t addressed. It states ≈neither can live while the other survives. 
Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore. 
DUMBLEDORE It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry. 
HARRY One of us has to kill the other...in the end. 
Dumbledore nods, and there are tears misting his eyes. 
DUMBLEDORE Yes. 
They sit quietly together. Dumbledore softly wipes a tear from his cheek. 
EXT. GREAT LAKE - DAY 
Harry sits by himself on a boulder by the side of the lake. He watches the sunset. 
198. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK Hello, Harry. 
Harry turns to see NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK, a GHOST, standing beside him. 
HARRY Hey, Nick. 
Nick looks uncomfortable. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing. 
HARRY Oh. Thanks. 
He stands and they begin to walk back to the castle together. 
HARRY Nick, I was wondering about something? 
Nick looks even more uncomfortable now. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK I»ve been expecting this... 
HARRY Expecting what? 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK A lot of people come to me when they»ve lost loved ones. 
HARRY I expect so... 
There is a silence. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK He»s not coming back, Harry. 
There is another silence. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK Few wizards choose the path I have chosen. 
HARRY Why? 
199. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK I am neither here nor there, Harry. Trapped between two worlds. That does not appeal to most. (pause) I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I preferred to survive as a feeble imitation of life than face the vast unknown. (pause) I often wonder if that was a wise decision. 
They approach the great doors leading to the entry hall. 
Nick looks at Harry. 
NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK I»m sorry I couldn»t be of more help, Harry. Truly I am. 
Nick vanishes through the wall into the castle. Harry steps through the doors into the entry hall. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
Harry enters. 
HERMIONE Harry! 
He turns to see Hermione and Ron racing down the steps towards him. 
Hermione throws herself into Harry»s arms in a huge bear hug. 
HARRY How are you?RON Good as new, mate. 
Hermione pulls herself away from Harry and looks at him closely. 
HERMIONE (quietly) How are you doing, Harry? 
Harry pauses for a long moment, thinking. 
200. 
HARRY Better. 
HERMIONE Come on, let»s go in to the feast. 
Harry shakes his head.HARRY You two go on. I want to be alone for a while. 
Hermione nods. They turn away and begin to walk into the great hall. 
HARRY I»ve got something to tell you. Something important. 
They stop and look at him again. 
HARRY But not right now. I»m not ready. 
HERMIONE Take your time, Harry. We»ll be here when you are. 
She smiles at him. Ron and Hermione disappear into the great hall. 
Luna comes down the stairs carrying a stack of papers. She goes up to the NOTICE BOARD and attaches one of the papers to it. 
She turns and sees Harry. 
LUNA Hello, Harry. 
He walks up to her. 
LUNA It»s the last night and I need to pack. 
HARRY Then why are you putting up signs? 
LUNA Oh, people take my things and hide them. 
(MORE) 
I don»t think they like me much. Some of them call me ≈Loony Lovegood. 
Harry looks at her in pity. 
HARRY Do you need any help looking? 
LUNA Oh no. It all turns up in the end. 
She looks at him serenely. 
LUNA Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather. 
HARRY Yeah.(pause) Have you ever...you know... 
LUNA My mother. I was nine. 
HARRY I»m sorry.LUNA It»s okay. It»s not like I»ll never see her again. 
HARRY Isn»t it? 
LUNA Don»t tell me you didn»t hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? 
Harry looks startled.LUNA They were just out of sight, that»s all. 
HARRY You mean we»ll see them again? 
LUNA Of course. (pause) Things always work out, in the end. 
201. 
LUNA (cont'd) 
202. 
She smiles at him. Then she heads back up the stairs and into the feast. 
Harry is left alone in the entry hall. He turns and looks into the glorious sunset. 
For the first time in a long time, Harry smiles too. 
FADE OUT
